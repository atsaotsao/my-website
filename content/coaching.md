As of this moment, I have coached 969 hours over the span of 4 years. 

And in this journey I've coached around:
- building digital products and launching them
- productivity and habit-building 
- lifestyle design
- overcoming limiting beliefs / changing patterns around negative self-talk
- unlearning self-sabotaging tendencies
- mindfulness / meditation & visualization exercises
- leading life & work with more self-love, trust, and compassion
- finding alignment in one life
- creative & authentic expression

But I am finding myself re-orienting this work to re-center and respond to what witnessing to the genocide happening in Gaza and the large internal tectonic shifts that have been happening for me since.

I'm not even going to lie. It's kicked my ass.
But I feel awakened to something that I'm finally feel called and ready to translate and transmit into the work that I do.

I am in currently in the process of learning to put truth to words, to no longer avoid or bypass all the things that deeply scares me, and to create a new 1:1 & even group coaching container from that place. 

I am working on putting together offers that comes from the soul that hopefully resonate with you folks. If you are interested in learning more please feel free to [reach out!](mailto:andrew@codelesscoach.com)

Stay tuned!
