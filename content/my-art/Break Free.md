The month of December has recently been my favorite time of the year. 

I used the opportunity of having some down time while traveling my brother and his wife in California to enjoy a bit of sun, grass, and art. 

I've been using the downtime I have this month to pause, breathe, think, and be.

While being here in Southern California, I made sure I started all of my days out in the backyard, meditating while facing the warm glow of the sun. Then I'll walk around and enjoy the grass on my feet, the sights, sounds, and scents of the two beautiful orange trees, the extravagant bold pink of the two crape myrtle trees, that one avocado tree that I've never seen bear fruit, and all the different animals and insects that live or visit them. 

It made me think about the incredible amount of gratitude and love I am feeling. 

I thought about my past year of being an entrepreneur.
I thought about my partner and now fiancé.
I thought about my family, living here, there, and everywhere.
I thought about my friends. New friends. Ex-friends. Ex-lovers. 
I thought about Taiwan. 
I thought about Palestine, especially the children living in Gaza strip.
I thought about war, of death, and about all the things in life that are out of my control.
I thought about my younger self.
And I thought about my future self.

And with this door, this painting, this art, I decided to create something for all of my selves, for all my thoughts, and for everyone and everything I have or will care for. 

With this piece "Break Free", I hope to create a door, a sign, a lighthouse, a permission slip, and a portal for anyone looking at it to find the courage to break free.

Break free from limiting beliefs.
Break free from the fear that is keeping us from expanding.
Break free from jobs, people, places that no longer serve us.
Break free from toxicity and negative thinking.
Break free from familial and societal expectations.
Break free from the cycles of intergenerational traumas.
Break free from learned unhealthy behaviors.
Break free from the incessant need to be liked by others.
Break free from hedonic treadmills.
Break free from misinformation.
Break free from systemic oppression and racism.
Break free from colonial and capitalistic thinking.
Break free from ego.
Break free from survival.

Break free, my friends. And I believe in you ❤️
