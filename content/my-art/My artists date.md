Last week I took myself on a artists date

The term "artist date" is coined by author Julia Cameron in the book The Artist Way and for her, its considered a vital practice for nutrurng creativity. She described it as 

"A block of time, perhaps two hours weekly, especially set aside and committed to nurturing your creative consciousness, your inner artist. In its most primary form, the Artist Date is an excursion, a play date that you preplan and defend against interlopers. You do not take anyone on this Artist Date but you and your inner artist, a.k.a. your creative child.”

I'm not stranger to carving time for this artist, for this child to play and explore. 

But I realize it's been a while since I took him outside on a "proper" date just him and I. 

So I took him enjoy the spring bloom, to do some people watching, and to the MOMA musuem.

I'm reminded of this important part:

That he doesn't need fancy or expensive things. He just needs some attention.
To show that I care about him, and believe that he's a huge part of my life now. 

And I remember taking this vidoe as I was walking out of the museum just as proof

to see myself absolultley BEAMING. Reminding myself how much joy I felt.

and reminding myself that I deserve to be this joyful.

And I deserve to build a life filled to the brim with this kind of joy. 

When's the last time you took your inner artist on a date?

Last week, I finally took myself on a real artist date.

(And no, it wasn’t a 10-day retreat in Bali. It was me, some spring blooms, class NYC people-watching, and the MOMA.)

Julia Cameron, who coined the term "artist date" in The Artist’s Way, describes it as this:

“A block of time, perhaps two hours weekly, set aside to nurture your creative consciousness. A solo play date with your inner artist. No plus-ones allowed.”

Now, I'm not a stranger to carving out “creative time.”  
But somewhere along the way, I started treating it like another item on a to-do list.  
You know the vibe:  
☑️ Meditate  
☑️ Journal  
☑️ Be creative (but make it productive)

This time, I let it be the kind of date that I know will make my inner artist smile.
Unstructured, spontaneous, and a little messy in the best way.

And here’s what hit me:
→ Your inner artist doesn’t need expensive supplies, luxury retreats, or 14 productivity hacks.  
They just need to know you still give a damn.

That you’ll show up.  
That you’ll pay attention.  
That they’re not just an accessory you dust off when it’s “convenient.”

I even snapped a quick selfie that day, right there in the museum, absolutely beaming.  
Not because anything major happened.  
But because joy did.

And honestly?  
I deserve to be that joyful.  
And so do you.

So, when’s the last time you took your creative self out on a proper date?  
(And no, doomscrolling doesn’t count.)

Would love to hear what you’d plan.
