The knot in my chest is so heavy & deep.
I've creid.
I've wallowed. 
I've raged.
I've screamed.
 I've dstracted.
 I've smoked.
 I've dance.
  I've drew.
  I've morned
  I've don't anythign I can think of but it's still there. It scares the absolute shit out of me. It maeks me want to screan punch the wall. It maeks me want ot launch myself at structures and people like I'm a catapoul shooting rocks at walls and castles during medieval times.

I'm also so scared to admit this is my own doing. 
That I'm causing my suffering.
That I'm responsible for the lack of feeling safe.
That I'm still accountable for the shitty feelings in my body. 
Waht a bore to take responsilbity fo this.
How fun is it to blame it on others.

How frustrating it is there just fucking making itself comfortablel. Like a toad in a castle, just chiling and unwilling to move.
Waht d you need. Have you found a new home even though I don't want you here?

O knot, O knot
Waht do you need from me?
