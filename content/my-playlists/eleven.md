### Description:

Ever since I've watched Season 1 of the Netflix show *Stranger Things*, I've been completely obsessed with the retro, uber 80's synth sound used throughout the show that contains so much excitement, ominousness, mystery, and nostalgia all layered together in the music. So since Season 2 came out last month, I wanted to create a playlist as a tribute to Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein's amazing soundtrack and to one of my favorite characters in the series, Eleven. When creating the playlist, I centered the sound direction around two popular synth-pop artists I love, Electric youth and Chromatics, who were both first introduced to the mainstream audience in the soundtrack of the movie "Drive." Every time I heard the lyrics "**A real human being and a real hero"** from Electric Youth's "A Real Hero", I always picture it to a backdrop to a character who would always play the role of the tragic hero, often sacrificing his/her life for the greater good. While digging around to find new music to include in this playlist, I've also discovered artists like Touch Sensitive, Promises Ltd, French 79, and The Midnight who are modern bands who are taken this retro-wave sound and interpret it to a new generation of listeners in different but equally electrifying ways. It's crazy to me that these old sounds are making a comeback and had made their way all the way around to influence today's pop music. The truth is that the state of music is just as what The Midnight sings in "Lost and Found:"

> Oh, but nobody knows where it goes
> When it goes

Enjoy!
