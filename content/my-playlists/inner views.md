### Description:

October for me was the month of interviews. On average, I went to about 15 interviews a week, and I needed a playlist to get me through them so I turned to a compilation of some of my favorite chillwave and indietronica sounds. The playlist centers around Tycho and ODESZA, both bands came out with new albums this month and have both found strong following this past few years through their unique use of melodic electronic music that gives you the sense of euphoria as if you're floating on clouds; or driving out of a sunset. I'm also using this opportunity to introduce some of my other favorite new artists to my listeners: Instupendo, Kate K-S, and Cinnamon Chasers. M83's "Holograms" was my pick of the track this month that would most likely bring you to tears; they are so much more than the track "Midnight City" and "Wait", songs that made them radio famous. Ending the list with Max Richter's "Summer 3", an unbelievably powerful recomposition of Vivaldi's Four Seasons. 

Enjoy!
