### Description:

This was my first love letter to my now girlfriend disguised as a playlist. The opening lyrics in the first song "your text" says it all.

> Hey pretty stranger
> I think you look cute
> Can I get your number
> I wanna know you

I met her as I was walking into a Japanese restaurant in New York's East Village. She was walking out as I was walking out. A week and a night of arepas later, we started our summer of romantic adventures. In this playlist, I've layered songs that simply tuck at my heartstrings. The gravitas in Jacob Collier's voice, or the soulfulness of Daniel Caesar and Jordan Rakei are there for you to close your eyes to, while the colored indie tones of Shy Girls, Electric Guest, and Swim Good Now are pairs nicely to other jazzy tracks as white wine to seafood. A season of romance is multi-colored and full of tonal improvisations, and I can't wait for the upcoming symphonies.

Enjoy!
