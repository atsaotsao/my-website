### Description:

> Summer days far away
> Can I make you stay?

I opened my playlist with Rhyeâ€™s beautiful voice, drifting in like summer rain, Then I lined up danceable tracks one after another. Tom Misch, Kaytranada, and Cherokee are all modern pioneers of funky Indie Soul and their music makes you feel like you're on a yacht with a watermelon margarita on hand. While dancing is the central theme of this playlist, most of the songs I chose are songs that simply just made me smile. The triple attack of HAIM, the classic Vulfpeck hit, and Washed Out's new track all serve as the perfect background to me bobbing my head all the way to work. Right when you think things are dying down, the beats of Lane 8, Justin Jay and Kasbo keep the party going. Finally, I ended with deadmau5's song "Pets", creating the imagery of something coming to focus then fading away. Summers always create the strongest memories for me and experiences that I hold on to the longest.

Enjoy!
