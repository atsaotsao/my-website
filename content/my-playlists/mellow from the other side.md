### Description
This month, we're taking a leap into a dream I had a few days ago. You're immediately welcomed into the dreamscape with sounds of birds chirping and insects in Washed Out's "Entrance." The in Beach House's "Dive" we start off with the hauntingly beautiful and droning vocals that crescendos as the guitar starts to build and reaches the line that reminded me of my dream:

> Is it my imagination?
> Shadow, flicker creation

In my dream, I am just floating on my back in a sea of memories, all in gradient colors according to the kind of emotions it contains. The sounds of new indie artists that I love, Mellow Fellow, girl in red, Jadu Heart, and Mitski, all convey the waves and waves of ennui I'm feeling in this dream. Just when I'm slowly sinking into the darkness, Fractures song reminds me:

> It's Alright...
> Don't get dragged through
> Don't be consumed
> Don't catch it through
> Don't be consumed.

It pulls me back up and pulls me awake. I look around and see my girlfriend sleeping next to me and remind myself that I'm no longer swimming aimlessly with her next to me.

Enjoy!
