### Description:
I've just moved into my new apartment and I'm beyond excited for this new chapter of my life to start. This playlist paints the mood I'm in: sitting on my grey IKEA couch with my cat, Dola, surrounded by walls of unopened moving boxes; feeling content and excited for what's ahead. Since I'm in Brooklyn, this playlist is all about the new, the fantastic, the awesome indie bands. First to bat are a handful of bands with women on vocals, No Vacation, Men I Trust, and The Marias, who all use simple guitar backed melodies paired with a delicate voice to bring in waves and waves of serious chillness. Two more bands, both with Japanese in their names but neither of them ethnically Japanese (One is half Korean, the other white) and have a lot to say; one sings about thinking about someone with a **face like thunder,** the other about getting a **road head on a turnpike exit**. As the sun sets, and I've finished setting up my speakers and swaying to The Flying Stars of Brooklyn NY's "My God Has A Telephone," I turn my subwoofer up a tiny bit and switched gears to a few songs with a more beats being laid down. Let's just hope I don't get a noise complaint on my first day here. 

Enjoy!
