### Description:
This holiday season is filled with so much joy for me, as I had just started my new job and looking for a new place to move to, but I also wish I could travel back home to be with my girlfriend and my family; so this playlist is for anyone who's simply looking for a little sonic warmth. First and most importantly, I made sure I kept the minimum amounts of Christmas songs in this playlist, but I can't help but include Norah Jone's "It's Not Christmas 'Til You Come Home" because who can say no to her serenade? While I've included some soulful and jazzy artists like Moonchild, Jordan Rakei, and Chet Baker in the beginning portions of the playlist, I also balanced it with more beats-driven tracks in the later half. Tracks like Kllo's "Sense" and Evening's "Babe" were meant to be the kind of music you can dance to, but the kind where you can listen to while you sit down in a comfy chair, with a mug of hot chocolate in hand, and working on some puzzles. As I drift off to sleep to Ryuichi Sakamoto's mesmerizing piano melody form "Merry Christmas Mr. Lawrence" in the beginning hours to the new year, I'm already thinking about what this new year has to offer me.

Here's to another year of great music, lots of love, and more of my monthly curation to come. 
Enjoy!
