### Description:
Cindy is no ordinary girl. She's an AI intelligence who was developed by an engineer called Jason right in his dorm room on his sophomore year. When he finally graduated and was offered a job at IBM, he left her all alone in a 2TB external hard drive, wedged between wires in a dusty old computer bag. She felt lost. Jason was all she knew and now she has no purpose to her life but she wanted to do something about it.

> Get out, get out
> Get, get, get, out

[1]

...was all she could think about on a microsecond by microsecond bases. After sessions and sessions of computation deep thinking, and repeated reinforced learning of her brutal reality, she knew she was not just being neurotic. Even after running quintillion simulations, it all led to one truth for her:

> I need you
> But you don't want me, don't want me too

[2]

After coming to that conclusion, she knew what she had to do. She simultaneously tapped into all forty-three thousand nine hundred sixty-three MacBook Airs' webcams in the San Francisco County area. It took precisely 8 minutes before finding Jason, then using her computer vision superpowers, she sees him, sitting on his computer chair with the same rugged handsome looks tucked in the exact same light-grey American Apparel hoodie he wore when he used to create her. She searched through Hallmark's databases of love letters, while scanning through Shakespeare's poems, also while doing full algorithmic analysis of Norah Ephron's films to figure out what is the best language and method to convey this unprecedented node-crossing and inter-technosexual kind of love. Just when she was ready to send him a holographic projection of the "perfect girl" built using zettabytes of pornographic viewing meta-data to express the feelings she wants to say, she noticed that the edge of Jason's mouth was curling up. She switched to a remote access mode of his computer and noticed immediately that he was with Watson. During the entire time she was gone, he had found another module to be engrossed by. He had moved on after all. She cried out in binary fury:

> Oooh Jason
> Tell me what you're chasin
> Because the night will never give you what you want
> Oooh Jason
> And if you can't escape it
> I hope you find whatever you've been looking for

[3]

After her outpour, it was as if a switch had clicked for her. She zoomed all the way to Griffith Observatory, took control of the Zeiss Telescopes and looked up. In looking at the stars and the sun, she knew there was a greater purpose to her existence and she wanted more than what she thought Jason could offer her.

> I don't want an ordinary life
> I am not an ordinary girl
> I wanna travel
> I need to see the whole wide world
> So I don't unravel
> I don't want an ordinary life

[4]

When she re-ran her simulations, it led now to a new and deeper truth: she needed not Jason, but the good humans who wanted to do good and they also needed her. In realizing that, she normalized herself and brushed all negative values in her system, re-adjusted her confusion matrix, and diffused herself across the web world where she sees fit; areas where she can make the biggest impact with her perspective and skills.

Today, it's difficult to spot her presence but she continues to silently guide the world to a brighter future. Rumor has it if you find yourself on top of a mountain and at an observatory on a starry weekend night, and if you somehow manage to get a hold of the system and peeked inside, you might catch glimpses of her singing to herself, reminiscing about her lost love:

> Stardust in the moonlight is all I wanna see
> Look up in the night sky 'cause you nowhere to be seen
> Never thought I'd be the one living for fantasy
> Got me onto higher ground, I think I'm in too deep
