### Description:
When Spotify first debut their feature "Discover Weekly" in 2015, it was the first time I really felt the eerie power of personalized song recommendations created by algorithms. I remember feeling excited whenever Monday arrived because it meant the data gods will be pushing a brand new 30-songs long mixtape right to my home page; just for me. The more I binged on my Discover Weekly playlists the more I'm fascinated and troubled by it: fascinated because as all the recommendation felt **spot on** and they found the perfect balance between recommending songs that are closer to the mainstream while others are on the spectrum hidden gems still just waiting being discovered. I was also troubled because I became more aware of being trapped in an echo chamber of music taste. For the goal of broadening the range of the music taste, while also creating a place where it's easy for my friends to find new song recommendations, I decided to create a playlist. This playlist wouldn't just be like any other playlist, I will curate 25 songs on the 25th of every month and each of them will be curated to be listened in order and would always revolve around a central theme: a mood, a pun, or a scene. Finally, I will also end with a classical song that I love because, you know, to stay classy. Enjoy!
