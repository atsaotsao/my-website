1. Regardless of where I am in life, how much money is in my bank account, or how I'm feeling, I will always be safe and going to be okay because I got me, my family and loved ones got me, my ancestors got me, and the universe got me.
2. All is well, because this too shall pass.
3. There is wisdom, power, and magic in my breath. And I can take it wherever I go. 
4. Whatever big or difficult emotions I am feeling, I can acknowledge it, accept it, and allow it to pass through me and over me.
5. My thoughts are my thoughts. My emotions are my emotions. But I am neither my thoughts and nor my emotions.
6. I am exactly where I need to be in my journey, I just need to keep going.
7. I can only focus on the things I can control, and surrender to the rest.
8. Breathing is healing and liberating all parts and versions of ourselves. Especially the version of ourselves that are trapped in time and in our bodies.
9. I can accept and love all things that arises unconditionally. I am love.
10. I am not afraid of death. Death is a natural part of our lives. I want to embrace it and live my life to the fullest.
11. This is the most important practice I can do and I'm committed to practicing it for as long as I live.
