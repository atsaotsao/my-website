This year is when I finally understood what it meant to be intentional about one's life. 

I learned that the art and beauty of my life, has never been about the applause, achievements, destination and even people. It's about the moments. It's about the inherent magic in these moments, and recognizing what all the external and internal voices, influences, and powers that gets in the way of those moments; blocking and robbing us on them. 

This year I am learning that our soul speaks to us in moments; in whispers. It's always nudging, supporting, and guiding us toward seeing the truth about ourselves and the world we are living in and helping us experience the greatest amount of joy, purpose, abundance, and freedom that is within all of us and we all so deserve. It's helping us see the interconnectedness of our mind and bodies to our ancestry, community, indigeneity, natural world, and everything in between. 

And I'm committed to continue embrace the beauty and art of my life next year through presence, service, acceptance, and surrender. 

What is the art of your life?
