I just want the kind of electronic sounds that bring me to that zone where I feel like the shadow and light coexist

That the dance is about the union of those two forces. Because I feel that in me. That anger has gave me so much pain for such a big part of my life now and I accept it. And I just want to dance with it. Remember it, and channel it to everything I'm doing. It fuels my power.
