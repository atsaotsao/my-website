The 5 minutes before my coaching calls are actually some of my favorite moments and aspects about being a personal coach.

Sometimes I will use this opportunity, to get my space tidy up, to get situated, but my favorite part is closing my eyes and just allowing myself to feel the gratitude of being able to do this work. 

I’ll think to myself:

  
How in the world did I get here. Where ME. I get to get paid to help someone on their transformation journey, to love and accept themselves more, to create and express their true authentic selves to the world, and to help them accomplish their personal and professional goals. 

And I can do all of this from the comforts of my home. I am so grateful. What more can I ask for?




Sometimes I will use this opporutnity

I like to take some time to situate myself in my surrounding

To get settled in.

And to ground myself in gratitude. 

Most days I still can't believe THIS is what I get to do my living.

That I get to show up, do the work that matters to me

And at the same time, have the privilege to serve. 

To be a cheerleader, teammate, and true partner one's transformation journey. 

What more can I ask for?
