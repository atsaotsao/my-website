## **My AI Ethics Manifesto**

_as a creator, coach, and human navigating digital tools with soul_

**1. I believe in tools, not replacements.**  
AI is not my voice, my vision, or my values. It is a companion—a reflection board, a thought-partner, a sounding post. When I use AI, it’s to clarify or amplify what’s already inside me. It’s never a substitute for the creative pulse and artistry that comes from my own lived experience, lineage, and imagination.

**2. I honor creativity as sacred, not just productive.**  
I reject the notion that faster or trendier equals better. My creativity is not a commodity to be optimized. I honor slow art, imperfect expression, and the nonlinear process of making things with meaning. AI can help me shape, refine, or brainstorm—but it will never dictate what’s worth making.

**3. I respect the visual body.**  
Turning faces—my own or others’—into stylized or aestheticized outputs through AI crosses a line for me. There’s something deeply intimate about how we are seen. I choose not to turn that into spectacle or trend. My visuals come from real moments, intentional design, or hand-touched artistry—not synthetic replication.

**4. I stay in relationship.**  
The root of my work—whether coaching, creating, or sharing—is relational. I ask myself: Does this tool foster connection, or does it flatten it? Does this content move toward intimacy, or away from it? I commit to preserving human warmth in a world that increasingly feels automated.

**5. I aim to decolonize my digital choices.**  
I’m aware that AI is built on histories—of labor, of data extraction, of bias. I approach these tools with reverence and caution. I don’t believe in tech for tech’s sake. I strive to use digital tools in ways that reflect liberation, equity, and care—not just convenience or visibility.

**6. I welcome transparency.**  
When I use AI, I aim to name it. Not out of guilt or performative virtue—but because I want to be in integrity. I don’t need to pretend I do everything alone. But I do believe that _how_ I create is just as important as _what_ I create.

**7. I reserve the right to change.**  
This manifesto is a living practice. As I grow, learn, and unlearn, my boundaries may shift. What feels aligned today might not tomorrow—and that’s okay. I’m not here to be perfect. I’m here to be real.
