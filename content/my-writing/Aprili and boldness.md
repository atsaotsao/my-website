I want to be paid for giving a motivational speech this year, and I'm putting this out there into the Linkedin ether.

For the month of April I gave myself a goal to do one bold thing or make one bold ask each week 

And even though it's already Thursday I still want to put this out there.

One of the reasons I became a coach is because I love helping people connect more deeply to the parts of themselves that believe wholly in themselves. 

To do that thing they've been wanting to do for a long time, maybe even all their life.

But what if I can help an auditorium full of people feel more amped, and excited about their abilities to do just that?

There's a lot of things that has already happend in 2025 that are making people scared, and I just want to help people feel more courageous to tackle the rest of the year.

So here's my official ask:

If you (or if you know someone) who is looking for a speaker, facilitator, coach to help lift the a room up, then count me in. 

P.S. If you are feeling down and want a personal pep talk to hype you up, feel free to comment below or DM me 🙂

I want to be paid for giving a motivational speech this year, and I'm putting this out there into the LinkedIn ether.

For the month of April, I gave myself a challenge:  
Do one bold thing or make one bold ask each week.

And even though it’s already Thursday, I still want to put this out there.

One of the reasons I became a coach is because I love helping people connect more deeply to the parts of themselves that believe—truly, wholly—in their own voice.

The part that says:  
"Go do that thing you’ve been dreaming about.  
You’re ready. You’ve always been ready."

And now I’m wondering...  
What if I could help an entire auditorium feel that?

A room full of people feeling more alive, more brave, more connected to their purpose.

There’s already been a lot in 2025 that’s made people feel uncertain or discouraged.  
I just want to help people feel more courageous—to tackle what’s ahead with self-trust, clarity, and heart.

So here’s my official ask:

If you (or someone you know) is looking for a speaker, facilitator, or coach who can lift a room up—count me in!

P.S. If you’re feeling a little low and want a personal pep talk, drop a comment or DM me. I got you 🙂
