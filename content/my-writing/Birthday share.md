I'm turning 33 today. 

And I'm not exactly where I had thought my journey would take me, but boy, am I grateful. 

Grateful for all the twists and turns life has thrown my way.  
Grateful for the music and art that carried me here. 
Grateful for the teachers, guides, ancestors, and friends who have supported me.
Grateful even for this digital space (however flawed) that has let me share my light and love.

And truly, I'm grateful for y’all being here. Thank you.

Lately, I've been practicing receiving—letting others gift me with what they want to offer.

So here's my birthday ask:

I'm a huge fan of voice notes. Every time I get one, it feels like jumping into a little portal, getting transported into someone's world.

If you’re in a gifting mood, send me a voice note of:
- A memorable moment we’ve shared
- A song that reminds you of me or us
- A quote, poem, or movie line you love
- Any words of joy, love, or affection you want to offer
- A piece of advice you once received that stuck with you
    

It would mean the world to me to hear your voice 💛

And for my birthday, I only have one ask:

That you use this moment to celebrate yourself, like it’s your day too.

Celebrate who you are, exactly where you are, in this exact moment as you read this.

Because truly, nothing would bring me more joy than knowing you’ve done that.

Thank you for being here with me.
