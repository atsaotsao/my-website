Okay I just did something that probably made me a little less employable. 

I went through my ENTIRE job experience section and changed all the descriptions to make it a little bit, well, more me. 

I replaced all the fancy bullet-points of achievements, of products & features launched during my PM days, with a woven story of how each role played a significant role in shaping my journey. 

I know this makes me less employable because I have a feeling that it makes it more confusing for recruiters to find me or for applicate tracking systems to figure me out. 

The funny thing is, I'm also currently entering a chapter in my coaching career where I am actually open to aligned part-time roles (to weather the choppy seas of the current economical climate)

I've been itching to do this because for the longest time I wanted to appear as polished and professional as possible, because that's what everyone did. 

That's also the way we usually tell our stories through our resumes. 

But I realize that maybe I don't need to do that anymore. 
Maybe it's finally time that I feel courageous enough highlight the full weave of my career: 

One that is filled with ups and downs, twists and turns of someone who is way-finding, and trusting and embracing every step of hte journey.

Steve Jobs once famously said in his 2005 Stanford commencement speech: "You can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future."


P.S. If you or know someone who is hiring part time for [insert part time position fitting for me]

Okay, I just did something that probably made me a little less employable.

I went through my ENTIRE job experience section and changed all the descriptions to make it a little bit, well, more me.

I replaced all the fancy bullet points of achievements, of products and features launched during my PM days, with a woven story of how each role shaped my journey.

I know this probably makes me less searchable by recruiters or even less readable by the robots (hello, applicant tracking systems üëã).

The funny thing is as I'm building my coaching practice, I‚Äôm also currently entering a chapter in my coaching career where I‚Äôm open to aligned part-time roles (to help weather the choppy seas of this current economic climate).

But I‚Äôve been itching to do this for a long time.  
To stop trying to look perfectly polished.  
To stop presenting a clean, linear narrative when my path has been anything but.

Because that‚Äôs the truth for so many of us, right?

Our careers aren‚Äôt tidy little timelines.  
They‚Äôre weaves. Spirals. Seasons.

And I think it‚Äôs time we start honoring that.

So I did the thing.  
I told the story behind the roles‚Äîthe pivots, the lessons, the growth.  
I made my LinkedIn a little more human.

Steve Jobs once said in his 2005 Stanford commencement speech:  
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards.  
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.‚Äù

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing now.  
Trusting the dots. Letting the story breathe.

Come to @Andrew Tsao and peek for yourself.


P.S. If you (or someone you know) is hiring for part-time coaching roles, program facilitation,  curriculum design, content strategy, or anything that blends creativity, empathy, and systems thinking‚Äîlet's chat!
