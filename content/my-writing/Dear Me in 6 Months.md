Dear me in 6 months, I will make you fucking proud. 

I know you are already proud of me just for being and living. 
For accepting all of our selves, even the dark shadows. 
For really take the time to address the emotions and pains stored in our bodies instead of choosing to distract ourselves. 
For finding the courage to pivot to a new career path, even though it was the scarier choice.
For listening to our heart. 
For having the courage to keep shining our light. 

I will keep making you proud by choosing love every day. 
By showing up consistency with integrity, tenacity, and a good sense of humor.
By speaking our truth, however uncomfortable it may be.
By choosing to keep believing and trusting ourselves, even when others doubt us.
By choosing to run toward the things that makes us uncomfortable.]
By create containers of growth, safety, and accountability for all my future coachees.

You just wait.
