Dear depressed me in college, thank you for finding the courage to keep going.

Thank you for crying in the shower.

Thank you for finding reasons to simply get out of bed.

Thank you for going to class even though you found most things meaningless.

Thank you for feeding yourself, even if some meals were just frozen dinosaur shaped chicken nuggets.

Thank you for staying inside on Friday evenings smoking weed & watching Planet Earth.

Thank you for loving yourself and accepting yourself the best way you can.

Thank you for going on late night solo drives around L.A.

Thank you for learning to cleaning after yourself.

Thank you for reaching out to your loved ones and friends for support.

Thank you for listening to all those beautiful music.

Thank you for dancing.

Thank you for smiling.

Thank you for living. 

Thank you for everything, because I wouldn't be here if it weren't for you. 

I love you. And I will always be here for you.

Andrew
