“We do not have to love. We choose to love.”

When I read this quote from M Scott Peck’s book The Road Less Traveled, it haunted me. 

Growing up, I was always the kind of kid that pondered a lot about love. I always had the misconception that it was something we were born with and that we all love instinctually.

When I was compiling this reel, and when I looked at all these beautiful moments that @j.laureen.l and I had shared in the past 8 years

I don't see all those times that we had disagreed, fought, and argued. 
I don't see us projecting blame, fear, and anger at each other.
I don't see us throwing our hands up to give up, despite our extreme differences in how we see or interact with the world. 

I see us choosing love, time and time again.

That despite our shortcomings, flaws, traumas, shadows, and pain, we continue to learn to give each care, affection, recognition, respect, commitment, trust, as well as honest and open communication.

Its only through this love that I've learned about the point of all of this. And it's from that place that real transformation happened for me. It's also through having this privilege and luxury, that I am able to heal, to feel empowered and abundant enough to choose a life of service. 

Especially during a turbulent time of history where it can often feel like chaos is in every corner, that some days it can feel like there is more darkness than light, more evil than good

I know the only thing I can do is to choose to love.
