"Hold Fast, Stay True"

This is one of the maxims that the Navy Seals live by. 

 nautical phrase that originated in the days of wooden sailing ships. In a storm sailors would tell each other to “Hold Fast”, meaning to grab on to rigging or something solid and secure that had weathered previous storms to prevent being swept overboard. “Stay True” was the direction to the man at the helm to stay true to the compass heading to avoid being blown far off course.
