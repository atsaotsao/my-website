Good afternoon! 

At the start of the year, I made a commitment to myself to share more boldly about what I've been working on. I don't usually use email to share as much as I've been relying more on my socials to just "blast"  about it. But now more than ever, I feel that it's important create more intimate, personal spaces across our communities to share and be witnessed as we all continue to navigate the moment we find ourselves in.

Most of all, I just want to say how much I cherish the relationships I've built over time, and the people who've supported me along the way. You're receiving this because you've signed up to [Insert], one of the digital products I've built and launched in the past. Even though I've since closed the project & website, I really appreciate you for being part of my journey. 

**A bit of life update**: 2024 was a transitional year for me. I made the scary leap to step away from not just no-code but from tech to do coaching full time. I've been particularly drawn to coaching around clarity, overcoming limiting beliefs, and diving deeper into somatically paired mindset coaching. 

This year, I'm also expanding my work in two different ways:
1. to support emerging and executive leaders in improving their executive presence‚Äîto show up in their professional life with more clarity, confidence, and authenticity to make meaningful impact while staying true to their values.
2. to support creatives and entrepreneurs in rediscovering their creative boldness, reconnecting with their unique voice, and creating lives that feel authentic, aligned, and alive.

Both are extensions of my multitudes as a coach and as an artist and I can't wait to share more of those parts of me this year.

**But enough about me‚ÄîI want to hear from you.** What are you working on? What are your hopes and goals for this year? Let's reconnect. Whether via email, text, or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrew-tsao/). I always love catching up and celebrating the amazing things you're up to. It brings me so much joy to see you shine and I'm always rooting for you. 

Cheers to a beautiful 2025. No matter what. 

Looking forward to staying in touch,

Andrew
