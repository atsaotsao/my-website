## Writing

I used to believe that I am not the type of person that is ever going to be completely comfortable with sharing about myself online.

Like I'm talking about from a genetic compositional level. 

I used to tell myself that it's not just because I'm not good at it and not just because of the ways I was brought up, but the way my DNA is sequenced meant that I have a predisposition of feeling anxiety and overwhelm in online spaces. 

And as a millennial born in the late 90s, right when MySpace, Facebook, and subsequent horde of social media platforms and spaces emerge, I often felt like I was born in the wrong century.


### Early signs

There were early signs that maybe I wasn't exactly cut out for this type of internet stuff.

First there was Xanga (for any Gen z or gen x kids reading, it was a online blog that looked like [this](https://yesterhost.neocities.org/zine/issue-00/09/img/ss3.jpg)).

Not only did I not not know how to customize or format my blog like all my friends did, I remember feeling so self-conscious that my blog was mostly just empty. 

The only proud thing I did was finding a way put my favorite Naruto-themed picture as my wallpaer and for having this OG [Jay Chou song](https://open.spotify.com/track/7JWIGJpbc8Xm9xxu8gSCsT?si=0199d30199104b87) play as soon as you land into my website.

Then Myspace came along. (Did you know that Linkedin was actually founded *BEFORE* even Myspace? Neither did I)

Then Facebook.
Then Youtube.
Then Reddit.
Then Twitter.
Then Quora.
Then Pinterest.
Then Instagram.
Then Snapchat.
Then TikTok. 

And whenever each new thing came along, I will always give it a little whirl to see how I would interact with it

But it never felt right. 
I never felt safe in it.

That's when I created a limiting belief in my head that I lived by:
That maybe, just maybe, I am not meant to be online in a world where it will increasingly be more online.
\
And that is just the reality I had to sit with.


### Made it part of my identity

I was proud of that fact that I wasn't "online" as much. And that also meant that I felt like I was one of the only few people who was almost never on his phone. 

And I took so much pride in that. 

Every statistic I saw around social media being bad for our mental health validated everything I was feeling. 

I started to even unconsciously believed that I was "better" than the people who were always online. 

I judged people who would take pictures of their food or take selfies because I will think to myself: 

"I'm so glad I'm not like that. That I don't need to capture and share this moment just to feel seen in this world."

But I could never fully admitted to myself that I created that narrative in my head to protect myself, until I couldn't anymore.
### Pandemic changed everything

When I lost my job in the midst of pandemic in 2020, I was so scared of what to do. 

It was the first time I was so disillusioned with working in corporate America. I felt betrayed and abandoned by a company that I invested a lot of myself into. 

And losing my job during a time when 

could fhow much I didn't matter that it planted the seed of entrepreneurship in me. 

And something struck me.

I realize that there is no way I can learn to be an entrepreneur in this moment of history without learning to be comfortable sharing, connecting, and promoting myself on the internet.

So I started small. 

I was starting a music newsletter so I decided to share about it:
https://x.com/atsaotsao/status/1254111217972580353

Before that, for my entire lifespan of my time on Twitter, I had always been a browser. 

In fact in my entire lifespan, I had only tweeted 10 times: 
https://x.com/search?q=(from%3Aatsaotsao)%20until%3A2020-04-01%20since%3A2013-04-01%20-filter%3Areplies&src=typed_query&f=top

This was the first time I ever experience random strangers giving me genuine comments on something that was very personal to me an it felt powerful.

And I realize that if sharing can be as simple as these 140 character prompts, then maybe I can do it a little bit at a time. 

I found the `#nocode` community on Twitter that I felt like I could trade my experience of building with. 

I started to see it as a playground for my thoughts, ideas, and even my authenticity. 

I even shared puns. 

But soon I became much more comfortable sharing out loud projects and initiatives I was doing. 

I understood the power of `#buildinpublic` movement, where I can take people along my journey of building a product or even company so they be a part of all the ups and downs. 

When I first formed my LLC, I shared about it.

And this year, after a challenge from a friend, I recorded myself talking in front of the camera for the first time. 

I also started this newsletter as well as my own podcast. 

And today I share content daily about the work I do as a mindset & creativity coach and how it relates to ____

Here are my 3 biggest learnings from this journey so far:
### My Learning

#### The internet may be flawed, but it's what we got

Last year I had a sticky note on my work desk that read: "Accept what is, not what should be."

When it comes to our ol' world wide web, is so easy to point to all the ways the internet is flawed. 

How the promise of making us feel more "connected" continue to fall short.

And every subsequent technology from social media, to web3/AR/VR to now AI feels like its taking us down the wrong path, making us more disconnected with ourselves and with the world. 

But at the same time, this is the internet we have, so how do we make the best of it? 

And for me is realizing that I have the power and agency to use this internet as intentionally as I want. \

The internet is what you make of it. 

And the moment you are intentional about how you want to use it, you will find people who are also doing it intentionally.

Twitter is just toxic people talking about politics? 
I use Twitter to meet internet friends to talk about tech, to support each other on the ventures we're launching, and have also landed most of my podcast guests through there. 

Instagram is just influencers flaunting their wealth, lifestyle, 


Linkedin is full of executives and founders who are just humble-bragging?
I use Linkedin to share about my coaching journey, tips around self-love and personal development, and 




#### Sharing online is a mirror to your internal world

Every time young Andrew was feeling anxious scrolling through Instagram, or feeling overwhelmed trying to come up what he wanted to write in his tweet, or feeling shame when he opened LinkedIn

Those moments and feelings are the most powerful mirrors to the parts of me that I was too afraid to look at or admit to myself.

I was so scared to admit to myself that **I so badly wanted to express myself to the world and be seen and accepted**.

All of us do. 

I was just too scared to be rejected. 

Due to my people-pleasing tendencies I couldn't handle disappointing or being rejected by even just on individual 

So I couldn't imagine the possibility of potentially being rejected by tens, hundreds, or potentially thousands of strangers I have never met. 

I was so scared for them to see who I was really was, which was just an insecure kid who really just want to be loved as he is. 

That's when I started seeing this "online" as a practice partner. 

Whenever I notice any feelings of overwhelm or anxiety shows up when I'm on it, I take a second to just sit with it and notice what's coming up. 

And sometimes I would even close the app altogether and say to myself, "This is the best I can do today, and that's okay."

And this leads to my final learning

#### Sharing is the ultimate arena of practicing non-attachment
