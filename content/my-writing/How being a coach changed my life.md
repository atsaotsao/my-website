Before I became a coach,

I had never been in a professional relationship where we both say, “I love you” to each other.

I had never experienced such a deep connection with people I’ve never met in person.

I had never known how liberating it feels to witness someone shed years of limiting belief to embrace their authentic self.

I had never realized how much transformation can come from simply being present with someone.

I had never known what it truly feels like to help someone heal their relationship with themselves.

I had never believed that listening, truly listening, could be an act of love and healing.

I had never heard anyone say, “You’ve changed my life. Thank you.”
 
I had never felt a sense of gratitude so profound that it brings me to tears.

I had never believed my words and presence could inspire someone to pursue their dreams with courage.

I had never expected to learn so much from those I coach.

I had never been this committed to my own personal growth so I can show up better for others.

I had never imagined my purpose could be realized through the simple act of being myself.

I had never felt so aligned with my work that it feels more like a calling than a job.

I had never been more optimistic about the human potential.

I had never been more in awe and in love with interacting, witnessing, and serving other human beings.

I had never operate with more love, generosity, patience, and optimism on a daily basis.

And I am so grateful to do this work, and I'm just getting started.

I had never felt that just my natural strengths, quirks, and love as a human being could offer enough value for someone to pay for.

I had never been more excited to jump on Zoom calls.

I had never witnessed how simply offering a safe, judgment-free, loving, and supportive space for someone over 6 months could lead to growth and transformation across all areas of their life.

I had never been more humbled by my work.

I had never been more optimistic about the human potential.

I had never been more in awe and in love with interacting, witnessing, and serving other human beings.

I had never truly understood how it felt to do work that deeply aligns with my soul
