Living life as an artist is practice
You are either engaging in the practice or you're not. 

It makes no sense to say you're not good at it. 
It's like saying, "I'm not good at being a monk."
You are either living as a monk or you're not. 

We tend to think of the artist's work as the output.

The real work of the artist is a way of being in the world.
