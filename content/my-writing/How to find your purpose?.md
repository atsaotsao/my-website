I always refer to the word "purpose" as the *Big P*. 

I am no stranger to thinking about the *Big P*.

The first time I really danced with the *Big P* was in 2012 after I had just came back from a Career Fair that was hosted on campus.

Today as I'm typing this newsletter, is the first time ever I finally stopped pondering about the *Big P*, and I want to share with you 5 things I have learned to help you get there. 

One. Reframe what it means to find your "purpose"

The step I did for myself is to acknowledge how
