I am excited to announce the launch of my new podcast, "[The Joy of Building](https://joyofbuilding.transistor.fm/)"

In this show, I want to explore how to build great things that deeply transform ourselves and others.

In this debut episode, I interviewed Sukhpal Saini ([@thisisukh_](https://twitter.com/thisissukh_)), cofounder of [Engyne](https://engyne.ai/). Sukh talks how he built 30+ products through overcoming failure, how he got his first 10 customers through building in public, and how he went from being a security guard to a founder through the power of visualization.

On today's episode you'll learn:

- 🌞 The Power of **Reframing Failure**
    
- 🚀 Why **Building-In-Public** works
    
- 🏋️‍♂️ The **Isolation Method**
    
- ⭕️ Beauty of **SEO**
    

Here are a few juicy excerpts from [today's episode](https://joyofbuilding.transistor.fm/episodes/1-sukhpal-saini-lessons-from-building-30-products) to get you flowing:

**Learner's Mentality**: "I want to be seen as a resource. So to be a resource, you need to learn. You can't stop.” — Sukhpal Saini ([45:05](https://youtu.be/h51P5ekaZlQ?si=7kYhRF3uyOrMtvwG&t=2404))

**The Competitive Advantage of Persistence**: "I think building a startup doesn't feel like a risky but at all. There are other things in life that are way more riskier. Even if your product fails or something that you did fails, even if you raised money and then your your startup blew up and now you're back at 0. The fact that you've done that work to get your product from 0, completely from scratch, raising money, and then failing, you actually come out ahead of 99% of other developers that are out there." — Sukhpal Saini ([45:45](https://youtu.be/h51P5ekaZlQ?si=ToLfKezXy4m4xyM9&t=2808))

If you’re a founder or aspiring founder looking for inspiration to keep going on your journey, this episode is a must listen!

## 👀 **Come to My Senses**

_Every week, I round up all sorts of interesting things that I found on the internet that engaged with each of my five senses (sight, smell, touch, sound, taste). Enjoy!_

- Imagine what it would be like if you were the 10 millionth visitor of Rijksmuseum who got to [spend the night](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayp8BGySqyY&ab_channel=Rijksmuseum) beneath the [The Night Watch](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories/operation-night-watch/story/ultra-high-resolution-photo).
    
- Learn how to master your [sense of smel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynrbxy36erE&ab_channel=TED-Ed)l
    
- Have you ever wondered what happens if you touch a painting? Here’s [what happens](https://www.metmuseum.org/perspectives/videos/2023/6/metkids-microscope-touching-art)
    
- Every month I pick a theme and curate a [music playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7IqhwRWcoJSE1SLODoS0vX?si=36aac04ba4444805&nd=1) that’s meant to be listened to in order. (You can also read [the newsletter](https://preview.mailerlite.io/preview/337875/emails/102979548129265578) that goes with it 🙂)
    
- If are a fan of feta cheese, I highly recommend this delicious [NYT Receipe](https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023371-sheet-pan-feta-with-chickpeas-and-tomatoes) (feel free to substitute the honey with [Trader Joe’s Hot Honey Sauce](https://www.traderjoes.com/home/products/pdp/spicy-honey-sauce-076116) 😉)
