When I was in my mid twenties, I would use to say this to myself: 

"I want to be a modern billionaire. And that means that one day I would like to wake up in the morning and be able to say that I have positively impacted the lives of a billion people"

To me that was the loftiest, and most altruistic goal I can think of. 

It's also one of the core reasons that drew me to working in tech; to be a Product Manager for all those years. 

I wanted to be part of companies, products, and teams that genuinely solving problems that improved people's lives for the better, at a scope and scale that can get me closer to that goal of a billion. 

But it took me a long time, being fired, and taking few steps back to look clearly at the situation and realize a really harsh truth: 

That although it came from a good intention, it was selfish and completely fueled my by my ego.

By my selfish and even childish desires to want to be seen, respected, and admired as a successful and good person in the world. 

It's as if doing that, I will finally feel like my existence in this world and my core being is justified.

It reminded me of something Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, said about Elon Musk:
"Elon desperately wants the world to be saved. But only if he can be the one to save it."

When I started my first business doing 1-on-1 no-code coaching with founders in 2021, that's when I had a huge shift in perspective. 

I was working with just one client in September and I worked with her every day to help her turn her ideas into digital products. 

And I remember how fulfilling it was to help her navigate through these hurdles, and see the joy on her face when she had figured out something.

I felt my heart brimming with warmth, pride, and a deep satisfaction that I had added value, even if it's to just one person.

When we finished coaching, she even wrote a handwritten letter to thank me, and I still have it pinned right in front of my work space to this day.

I learned an important truth on that day: one of the keys to living a fulfilling life is to live a life of service. 

A life of service refers to a way of living that prioritizes helping, supporting, and contributing to the well-being of others and the community as a whole over personal gain or self-interest.

Here are the 3 biggest misconceptions I've learned about living a life of service:


[1] It has to wait until X or Y happens

We often tell ourselves that we need to wait until we are further in our career, more financially stable, and have taken care of all of ours, our partner, and our family needs before we can live a life in service of others.

Here are the most common versions I'll hear: 
- "When I make more money, then I'll be able to give more money to charity."
- "When I get a promotion or have a job where I have more power and status, then I will be able to have the power to serve the community."
- "When I'm older and have more time, then I will have more bandwidth to help others."

All of these realities are valid because that's often how the world makes us feel, that we are always lacking.

And we feel like we are lacking and survival rather than feeling abundant, we tend to close-of and be protective our of time and resourses. 

But in this process we rob ourselves of experience the inexplicable deep qualities of a life of living beyond ourselves. 

**Question to ask yourself:**
What is one thing you are waiting on before you can serve others? 

[2] It is about self-sacrifice

This one is especially for all the "Pleasers" out there who have already have strong tendency to put others above yourself. 

Living a life of service is not about self-sacrifice, but rather about aligning with a more expansive view of self that includes serving the greater good.

And it's crucial to understand that in order to do this, you need to learn to give to yourself first. 

You need to give to yourself:
- Unconditional love
- Acceptance
- Patience
- Permission to just be
- Space to heal

As an Asian man who grew up in Taiwan for the first 18 years of my life, I was deeply shaped by Confucian views around collectivism. 

This meant that unconsciously, I was always putting the collective over myself. I would often think about the needs, wants, and expectations of my family and extended family over my own needs. 

A year of couples therapy taught me that the most radical way to re-framing this view is realizing that the BEST thing we can do for the collective is to focus on the self first. 

By being honest, and giving our self what it needs, we are no longer suppressing our own needs. 

And when we choose to serve others and the collective, we are no longer doing it from a place of self-sacrifice  and self-neglect, but a genuine desire to serve. 

And it is from this place we can also fully tap into the abundance. 

**Question to ask yourself:**
What is something you need to give to yourself first before you can start serving others? 


[3] It has to look a certain way 

There is a reason why becoming a doctor is the stereotypical, quintessential poster child of career that immigrant parents want us to have. 

It's because it checks the the trifecta of what supposedly leads to a fulfilling life:
- Prestige
- High Salary
- Job Security

But what is often buried beneath the surface of what makes being a doctor such an incredible and respectable profession is actually how it also can embody living a life of service. 

Doctors that I've spoken to who are patient, warm, and kind often talks about how joyful it feels to be able to have the expertise to help others. 

But you do not need to be a doctor to be live a life of service. 

Living a life of service doesn't have to look one single way. In fact with the modern world comes modern problems, and it's up to you to figure out what is a creative way you can combine your unique experience and skillsets to how you can live live a life of service.

**Question to ask yourself:**
What does living a life a service looks like to you? And are there limiting beliefs there that is making it harder for you to integrate it to your own life?

[4] You can't build wealth with it 

There's a common misconception of believing that it an "either or" scenario when it comes to building wealth and living a life of service:

EITHER you find a path or career where you can live a life of service OR you find one where you can build wealth with it. 

A lot of us were taught at a young age that there is a separation between the two: helping others and building a sustainable life where you have financial freedom. 

But that was the problem from the very beginning. Not believing it's possible. 

Some my say that it's "unrealistic", but I have learned that it is often just not straightforward. 

It may require some risk to leap, courage to experiment, and curiosity to explore, but the output may be having the kind of career that brings you fulfillment across every criteria. 

Isn't that worth it?

**Question to ask yourself:**
If you believe that you can build wealth and live a life a service, what would you do?
