Life is a game that one plays according to the rules.

This is a quote from the book catcher in the rye. 

But most of us get lost in these rules. And in the process we forget even what it means to play or win this game. Let me explain. 


The moment we started school, we were all taught a very specific set of rules. 
These rules were based around merit: grades, papers, presentations, tests, and eventually degrees. 

Then the rules become a little more complex: the rules of adulthood requires certain jobs, salaries, promotions, and stability. 

And soon the rules also evolves to include a partner, kids, a home, vacations, and then teaching our own kids the same rules.

The perk of following these rules is that after age 65, you get the reap the rewards and "win" by doing whatever it is you want. And enjoy happiness, fulfillment, peace, and freedom that point forward, if your body and health allows it.


The most unfair thing about this set of rules is just the list of conditions it requires for us win this game 

We shouldn't have to wait till 65 or older to feel like we have finally won.

The moment I realized that is the moment I realize I didn't want to play the same game anymore. 

I want to create my own game with my own rules, where winning means that I also get to do whatever it is I want starting now. And that I also can enjoy happiness, fulfillment, peace and freedom, but starting now.

And it takes for me to start is to believe. To believe in myself to accomplish that. And I finally do now. I hope you will join me. I'll see you around!
