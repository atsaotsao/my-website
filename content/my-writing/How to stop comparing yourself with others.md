Competition has been my friend for a bulk of my life. 

As the younger brother of two, it had helped me become more independent and capable to catch up to my older brother who was always bigger and more knowledgeable than me.

In high school, 






I've been reflecting on my personal development journey these past weeks and I often said that it started in 2020 during the pandemic. 

But the truth is that it started in 2011 after my first ever suicidal ideation. 



Is competition your friend? 

This was a big question I've asked myself often over the years. 

I was always a competitive kid.








Recently I'm noticing that I'm comparing less. Because of my competitiveness, it used to be a very natural thing for me to compare myself with others. This is why I would struggle a lot when using social media. I would compare jobs and success. I would compare perceived levels of happiness. I would even compare the attractiveness of girlfriends. Some of this was conscious but the scariest kind was when it was done unconsciously.

This competitive energy, or the need to compare, as a source of motivation has pushed me to obtain a lot of growth mentality that allowed me to gain a lot of skills. It allowed me to excel at a lot of sports, and even things like video games and board games. But it took me a while to also realize that the same competitiveness was causing me so much unhappiness. So it's very exciting to be able to observe how I am able to slowly let it not affect me anymore. My goal is to learn to hold on to the edge that makes me motivated to be better, yet keep learning to focus on myself rather than comparison with others.
