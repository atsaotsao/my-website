This is a reminder to have trust.
Have trust in how the river of my flows
Even when I feel like its winding
In directions that I am unfamiliar in
Or am scared of going to 
Especially to domains where the ground
Isn't as stable, solid, as reliable as I'm used to
There are turns that feel muddy, cold, and frightening
And I also have my fiance next to me
Just two of us trying to figure it out.

It's more important than ever to have trust.
A deep trust in the universe while maintain a work discipline
That allows me keep pushing, keep working, keep trying.
I never expect things to take this long
But then again I never wanted to feel this good
To be this free, and feel this creative
Even though the bank account isn't as full.

Today and this moment I will choose to trust.
