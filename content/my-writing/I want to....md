I want to create better notes that synthesize knowledge for myself
I want to create more passive income 
I want to create more spaces of healing for my friends and my community
I want to one day move closer to my family
I want to be an anchor, someone whose patience can withstand any storm
I want to express myself to the fullest degree
I want to listen to more music
I want to empower more individuals to build out their idea
I want more people to create their own businesses
I want more people to create a good habit of writing daily
I want to create wealth
I want to be strong enough to physically climb the walls ahead
I want to use technology to empower people who need it the most
I want my parents to enjoy the most of their lives as they've sacrificed enough for my upbringing
I want to laugh more and make people around me laugh as much as possible
I want to take my girlfriend to travel as we've found ways to build wealth together
I want to show more people the path of optimism
I want to be powerful, and influence the world by simply shining as brightly as I could.
