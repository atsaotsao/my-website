## My version

I’M NOT YOUR COACH IF…

❌ You’re bothered by someone who’s very expressive with his face (yes, the eyebrows will move).
❌ You think creativity is only for “creative types.”  
❌ You’re uncomfortable with stillness, silence, or someone who takes intentional pauses before speaking.  
❌ You roll your eyes at the word intuition, or get itchy around a little woo.  
❌ You care more about credentials than lived experience.


I AM YOUR COACH IF YOU WANT TO WORK WITH SOMEONE WHO…

❇️ Brings their whole self to the table and creates space for you to do the same.
❇️ Isn’t afraid to cry with you, laugh with you, or sit in silence until whatever needs to emerge… does.
❇️ Approaches transformation with the energy of a jazz musician, a curious cat, and a mindfulness nerd rolled into one. 
❇️ Will be your biggest hype man AND the one who helps you meet your shadows with love.
❇️ Has logged over 950+ hours of coaching and is nerdy enough to track it in Airtable.


✅ Sees your career path not as a ladder, but as a living, evolving ecosystem.  
✅ Helps you untangle what’s yours from what the world told you you “should” want.  
✅ Believes in strategy _and_ softness, vision _and_ nervous system support.  
✅ Brings their whole self to the table—ex-product manager, artist, coach, creative weaver.  
✅ Isn’t afraid to cry with you, laugh with you, or sit in silence with you until the truth emerges.
