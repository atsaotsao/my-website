It feels scary to admit this but...

I often feel scared these days.

Scared about the future and where its heading.

Scared that people are losing their jobs, left and right.

Scared for the folks who are looking for jobs but feel more hopeless by the second.

Scared about getting new coaching clients during a season where there is more fear and people are holding their emotions, their purses closeer to the chest

Scared about the pressure that stress is putting on my relationships.

Scared for admitting all this out loud because sometimes I still tell myself stories that I need to show that I am a model of confidence, strength, and resilience or others won't want to work with me.

But the more I sat with this fear I realize this:

Fear can be so loud and so uncomfortable but it isn't actually the problem. 

The real danger?

It's losing connection the part of ourselves that believes in ourself.

Fear will always be there.
But so will your resilience. 




I know because these past few months I've been more scared than I've been in a while. 

Scared about failing. 

Scared about not being able to pay rent. 

Scared about losing my partner. 

And at I also jump on a lot of calls with folks telling me how scared they are
