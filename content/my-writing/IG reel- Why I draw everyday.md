The key to navigating this phase of an artistic journey is learning to tune out. To percent external pressures from entering our inner process and interfering with the pure creative state. Pg 254



Recently someone asked me, why do you choose to draw or make art every day? What does it have to do with your entrepreneurship? 

And the answer is creativity. Having a daily creative practice has helped me tremendously in my journey as an entrepreneur. It has helped me learn to be less attached to outcomes, to be less inclined to stuck in survival mindset, and it allows me to have more fun each day.

1) "creativity scar"
2) "creative confidence"
