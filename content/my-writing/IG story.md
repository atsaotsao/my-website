Today, I’m meditating on fire.

Fire has the power to nourish us—cooking our food, providing warmth, and even serving as a connection to the beyond.

But this week, the fires in LA are a stark reminder of its destructive side. The same element that sustains can also destroy homes, neighborhoods, and uproot entire families.

Fire holds duality: creation and destruction, warmth and devastation.

And today, I’m holding space for both.  
To grieve the burning and the people being affected by it, and to remind myself to feed this fire within me—to keep going, to keep loving, and to keep believing in the world I want to help build.
