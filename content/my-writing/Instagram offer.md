I'm not special. I have nothing you don't. I am just committed. To myself. To my soul. To my potential. 

Transformation will take as long or as short as YOU decide it will

Around this time 4 years ago I was...

💔 Unemployed, feeling lost and directionless
💔 Felt worthless without the job, salary, and stability
💔 Couldn't even sit through a guided meditation on Headspace
💔 Still scared to use my voice
💔 Had limiting beliefs about being an entrepreneur
💔 Did not consider myself as creative

I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. 

But deep down inside me, I knew the moment was begging me to listen. To be still, quiet, and be with all the discomfort and allow it to propel me to where I needed to be.

So I did. 

Now...
🦋 I've created my dream coaching business, working with inspiring individuals that I would never have dreamed of
🦋 Pivoted away from working in tech after 9 years
🦋 Operating at the highest level of self-belief and self-love I have ever experienced before
🦋 Meditated daily for the past 1126 days
🦋 Allowing myself to be FULLY seen each day, both online and offline
🦋 Trust my intuition like never before
🦋 Draws abstract art that explores the expansion of the self

🦋 Where could you be in a year if you decide to go all-in, and step into your potential?

Early this year I drew a line in the sand. I remember saying out loud that I was DONE playing small and dimming my light. I am more committed than I ever have been.

If you are at a crossroad, transition, or just starting you journeys, are ready to commit to yourself, and create and live the life of freedom and fulfillment you have always wanted

I have 2️⃣ spots opening for my 1:1 Fear to Freedom Accelerator coaching program ✨
