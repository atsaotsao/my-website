 I just finished a book called [*Interior Chinatown*](https://www.google.com/search?q=interior+chinatown&oq=interior+chinatown&aqs=chrome..69i57j46i433i512j0i512l3j69i60l3.3023j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8) written by an Asian American and it really made me think a lot about what it means to be a be Taiwanese-American in these times. Why it's so easy and hard at the same time being the so-called "Model Minority." As someone who didn't grow up in the States (I was born in California but moved back to Taiwan when I was only 1 year old), I had the luck of not experiencing the various versions of trauma that a lot of immigrants, especially children of immigrants, experienced. I never had these classic lunchbox moments where kids are disgusted by the smell of content of what an immigrant's mom packed for him. I never experienced direct or even subtle expressions of racism growing up. I never had to feel ashamed of either my Asian-ness or my American-ness. 

But coming to the states for college, I experienced all these little pockets of things that made me uncomfortable. I hate when someone pointed out with surprise that my "English was very good." I felt odd not fitting in the cultural clubs on campusâ€” I felt like I was too Asian for the Chinese American Student Association but yet too Americanized for the Chinese Student Association. I was basically one of the few only Asian men studying Communication as my major, which was dominantly white and female. 

But reading the book, the overwhelming emotion is the amount of gratitude of the immigrants who came before meâ€” especially the number of sacrifices they made just by playing the roles of fitting in and assimilating to an America that was not as accepting and understanding of how to co-exist with Asians. I am thankful for all have done, especially those who couldn't achieve their dreams due to any kind of discrimination of cultural repression that prevented them from being the fullest versions of themselves. They have done so to give me room, space, courage, and permission to be so today, and I want to remind myself to not let them down.
