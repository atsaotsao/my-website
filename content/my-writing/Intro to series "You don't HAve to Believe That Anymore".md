> Hey, I’m Andrew. I’m a Career & Creativity Coach—and in my work, I hear a lot of smart, thoughtful people say things like:

> “I need to have everything figured out before I make a move.”
> _“If I leave my path, I’m throwing everything I’ve worked for away.”_  
> _“Being multi-passionate is a weakness.”_

> And I get it—because I used to believe those things too.

> These kinds of beliefs sound harmless on the surface. Sometimes we don’t even realize we’re saying them.  
> But they’re often the exact stories keeping us stuck.  
> Small.  
> Stressed.  
> Burnt out.  
> Disconnected from who we really are.

> So I created this series to call them out—and offer something better.

**It’s like if MythBusters met Tony Robbins… but make it softer, deeper, and a little more liberatory.**  
Because truthfully?

> ✨ **You don’t have to believe that anymore.**

> In each video, I’ll unpack one belief I often hear—and show you what’s actually true underneath it.

> So whether you’re in a career transition, feeling stuck in old narratives, or just ready to feel more like _yourself_ again…  
> welcome. This series is for you.

> Let’s start unlearning together.
