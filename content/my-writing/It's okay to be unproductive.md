There are just some days when you are just not as productive as you want to be. Whether its because you woke up on the wrong side of the bed, it's the weekend, you're traveling, your star signs tell you that Mercury is rising, it's hot outside, it's cold outside, you're sick, you're tired, you're bored; you just feel like you have an "off" day and no matter what you do you can't seem to claw your way back to your normal self. The most important thing you can do is to tell yourself, "It's okay, this too shall pass and tomorrow I'll be better."

It's often easy to forget how much pressure the external world puts on us to be better, faster, and smarter. Heck, the entire community here on Cowriters.app are built for people who want to build daily habits in order to hack our own personal development and be better than the person we are a year ago. It's important to remember to forgive ourselves when we do drop the ball, break a streak, and slept-in rather than tackle our growing to-do list. Only then, will we truly be the champions that can tackle anything that we put our mind to, one atomic habit at a time.
