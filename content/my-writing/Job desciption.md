I coach aspiring and non-technical founders to accelerate their journey of ideating, building, iterating, and launching their product idea, and learn to find more purpose, joy, and creativity through the process. 
  
A coaching session is great for you if you:  
  
✨ Want to stop just thinking about your idea and start building it 
  
✨ Ready to change your mindset about building your own dream and not just someone else's
  
✨ No longer interested in selling yourself short when it comes to your talents and skillset  

✨ Tired of feeling like you don't understand technology and what it takes to build a digital product or business
  
✨ Want to feel more confident in solving technical problems and navigating barriers of building an automation, a product, and a business on your own 
  
✨ Want to feel more attuned to your inner creativity, joy, and purpose
