Today I checked in with a coaching client I worked with a year ago—just to see how she was doing.

She sent me a voice note that brought me to tears.

She said:

"I think you’ll be happy and proud—the work we did together continues to evolve. I feel like I’m showing up well. And even though everything isn’t perfect, I feel happy in the present... and indulgent with the life I’ve been given."

It wasn’t just what she said.  
It was the way she said it.

I could hear it in her voice—a deep sense of inner trust. A grounded presence in her own journey.

And I couldn’t be more proud.

Honestly, the tears just kept coming.  
There are still days I can’t believe I get to do this kind of work.

All I can say is: I’m grateful.  
So deeply, humbly grateful.
