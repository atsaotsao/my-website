Landing back home after traveling in Europe for the two weeks, all expenses paid, with my partner & her family, I'm surprised to find myself moving through so much grief.

The vacation was suppose to feel nourishing and in many ways it was. I got to immerse myself in so much amazingart. Got to enjoy good food on every single meal. I'm got to really spnd some quality time with Laureen her family.

but it also reminded me of how much I've changed, especially how I now navigate the world around me. It's so fun, so freeing, yet so painful at the same time. It's like there are parts of how I perceive the world that I no longer can turn off. 

I noticed how much my body no longer cared for a type of traveling with an itinerary jam-packed to maximize seeing of all the sights. I didn't care the for extravagant indulgences that fueled my past escapist tendencies. 

I got to see and think about the different faces of empire, and connect the threads to how they are related to colonial influences that shapes my whole life. At one point, I saw the ships that bougth the opium to china and could even the feel the pain and anger of my ancestors.

I also witness a lot of codepending patterns with the family that was so painful for me because I found myself swept up int he gravitly

I've craved and wailed for hte three straigth days I'm back. Some sadness I knew wehre it came from, some just living in my bodyl.

The vacation was supposed to feel nourishing, and in many ways it was.  
I got to immerse myself in so much amazing art.  
Got to enjoy good food with every single meal.  
Got to spend some real quality time with Laureen and her family.

But it also reminded me of how much I‚Äôve changed.  
How I move through the world now‚Äîwith my eyes way more open, way more awake.  
It‚Äôs fun. It‚Äôs freeing.
And it hurts.  
There are parts of me that see too much now.  
And I don‚Äôt know how to unsee it.

I noticed how much my body no longer wanted the kind of travel packed with nonstop sightseeing.  
The extravagant indulgences I used to chase for escape just didn‚Äôt feel that good anymore.

I got to see and think about the different faces of empire‚Äî  
in the museums, in the monuments, in the stories that were missing.
And connect the threads to how colonial influences has shaped my entire life.  
At one point, I saw the very ships that once brought opium to China,  
and I could feel the grief and rage of my ancestors rise in my body.

I‚Äôm in a season of unlearning my codependent patterns in relationships.  
And on this trip, I got to witness‚Äîup close‚Äîthe kind of environment my partner grew up in.  
If she were a tree, I got to see why her trunk, her branches, her leaves grew the way they did.  
It helped me love and accept her more fully, just as she is.

But it was also painful.  
Painful to feel myself drawn into the gravity of those family dynamics‚Äî  
because I, too, wanted to be loved and accepted by her family.


I‚Äôve cried and wailed for three straight days since I‚Äôve been back.  
Some of the sadness I understand.  
Some still just lingering in my body that I'm still processing. 


This isn‚Äôt exactly a feel-good travel vlog, but I wanted to use this moment to share vulnerably‚Äîand let you witness me exactly as I am.

Because I‚Äôm not the same person I was before this trip.  
And honestly, I‚Äôm here for that.  
Thanks for being here with me.

Have you ever returned from a trip feeling more lost and more found at the same time?
