Today I want to share about what I've learned from the hummingbird. 


I've never really fully noticed, observed, and admired hummingbird until this past two weeks traveling in California.


Since then I've been seeing them all over. 
Fluttering around majestically.

Blink and you'll miss them


Then I learned about this powerful parable.
The story of the hummingbird, and what the indigenous group Haida calls *dukdukdiya* & the great forest fire.

When the great forest fire burned.
All the animals were afraid and fled from their homes. 

All except one.


The dukdukdiya would not abandon the forest.

It flew quickly to the stream, picked up a single drop of water in her beak.


Then flew back and dropped the water on the fire.


Again she flew to the stream and bought back another drop.

Back and forth
Back and forth


All the animals watching called out to warn her the dangers of the smoke and the heat.

"The fire is too hot!" sobbed the rabbit.
"There is too much smoke!" howled the wolf.
"My wings will burn! My beak is too small!" cried the owl

But the hummingbird persisted. 

She continued to fly
Picking up more water and dropping it
Bead by bead, onto the burning forest.

Finally, the big bear said, 
"Little Dukdukdiya, what are you doing?"

Without stopping, Dukdukdiya looked down at all the animals.

She said, "I'm doing what I can."


The hummingbird is teaching me about perseverance, resilience, and optimism. 

It reminds me that it's not necessarily the largest, most courageous, or loudest animal that can do the most good or have the greatest influence.

Rather those who are not afraid to act, and who are aware of what is at stake, can make a difference. 


Share this carousel with someone, a fellow dukdukya, who needs to see this today.

As always, I believe in you friend. Keep going ‚ú®
