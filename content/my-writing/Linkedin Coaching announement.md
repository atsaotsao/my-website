When I started my coaching business in 2021, I had no idea what I was doing. 

I had spent the previous half decade working in tech as a PM and even though I was used to fast-paced environments, being a solopreneur and coach was different.

I was swimming in waters I have never been in before.
 
It felt way harder. 
Colder.

It felt lonely.

Growing up in an immigrant family and household that had to relocate from China to Taiwan and started with nothing, the values of stability and avoiding risks was often preached. 

It made me realize why entrepreneurship was so foreign to me. 

It's also why I wasn't surprised when I look around at my family, peers, and people I had surrounded myself with and realized that there wasn't anyone who understood what I was doing or going through. 

And from that moment, I realize something important: 

I had to be the one to step up and overcome all my limiting beliefs, as well as the limiting beliefs that were passed down onto me, to make this leap happen. 

And as of this year, I've coach over 15 clients and with 750+ hours under my belt.

Coaching have created a career path and income source I could never have imagined which allowed me to not only have flexibility, diverse clientele, and a kind of work that was deeply fulfilling

But also a lifestyle of intentions, joy, growth, and freedom I had never ever experienced.

It made me realize what I was previously missing all my life.
It gave me a mission.

This is why for the next chapter, I want to help aspiring entrepreneurs overcome their own limiting beliefs to step off the sidelines and build something thats their own.

I know how hard it can be because I've been there. 

🚀 Today I am launching a new program to help aspiring entrepreneurs overcome their limiting beliefs to launch a coaching business and land their first paying client in 90 days.

I'm designing a completely new coaching experience:
1. I'll help you develop your foundation, mindset, and understand your unique zone of genius
2. I'll give weekly 1:1 support to keep you accountable to reach your personal and professional goals
3. I'll give you all the resources I've collected + everything I've learned in 2+ years in 90 days
