Three years ago, I was fired via a Zoom call from a job I loved. I've been fired before but this one in particular shook my world. 

Until then, I didn't even realize how much I had invested myself into it. And without it, I felt lost. I felt like a failure. 

It was around the same time New York went into lockdown. The U.S. was seeing the highest unemployment rate since the Great Depression. And me? 

There was a part of me that felt like I couldn't breath. I was so scared of all the uncertainty. I felt like I was drowning.

Being stuck at home and finding a way to keep myself from spiraling downward, I looked for things to keep myself busy and I stumbled upon "no-code". Then everything changed.

It gave me the superpower to start building my own products.

I decided to build my first product. Then I built another one. Then I built 10 more.

During this process, I made my first dollar on the internet. I had amassed hundreds of users. But most importantly, even though I've been a PM for 5+ years at that point, I finally understood the power of creating powerful digital solutions to solve the right problems.

And it felt incredible. I remember feeling something clicked deep inside me and I knew it was a pivotal moment not just in my career but in my life. 

For the first time ever, I was no longer scared and truly felt confident to navigate a world and future that was only going to become increasingly unpredictable and reliant on technology.

Since then, I've been working as a coach to empower aspiring and early-stage non-technical founders to build out their ideas, and to encourage them to discover purpose, joy, and creativity throughout the process.

I'm on a lifelong mission to help myself and others become the best version of themselves, and I believe that no-code's role in lowering the barrier of entry to building assets on the internet is going to play an increasingly significant role in that vision over the next few years and beyond.

If you are interested in working with me or are interested in learning more about what no-code can do for your business or your team, comment below or DM me 📨

I'm just getting started, and I can't wait to keep sharing my journey with y'all ✨

A few months ago, I was in an existential pit.  
  
AI was threatening the future of my business and I had no idea what to do about it.  
  
It felt like people didn’t seem to get how massive the implications were going to be for the future of work, talent and hiring.  
  
As someone who’s been working at the intersection of education and the future of work for the past 5 years, I could foresee the impact AI was going to have on many aspects of our work and lives.  
  
But the messaging around AI on social media was destructive and only worsened my existentialism.  
  
Making explanations overly technical, shrugging it off as hype, or spreading fear amongst those who are uncertain of what’s happening is not the right course of action.  
  
And look, I get it. The algorithm loves fear.  
  
But the narrative I needed back then, and the narrative many others need right now, is different.  
  
We need realism with a healthy dose of optimism.  
  
I’ve worked in tech since I graduated and have already seen a couple of hype cycles boom and bust, but I’m close to certain that AI isn’t one of them. Sure, attention is pretty inflated right now because generative AI is now accessible to the mainstream, but that doesn’t mean it’s the same story we’ve seen play out before.  
  
As non-techies who embarked on our own self-education journeys that went beyond the confines of the hype cycle, my friends and I realised how important it was for us to play our part in this technological revolution and lower the barrier to entry for literally anyone to understand what on earth this is all about.  
  
Having already built 25+ courses between us across everything from AI and no-code and from Web3 to knowledge management, Max H., Serj Hunt frsa, Scott Meyer and I are applying everything we’ve learnt to build a learning sprint that doesn’t instil fear, but confidence. That makes you feel empowered, not excluded. That makes you irreplaceable, rather than replaceable.  
  
If you lead a team of go-getters who you want to be ahead of this once-in-a-generation revolution, comment below or DM me 📨  
  
I’m on a lifelong mission to help create the conditions needed for human flourishing and I believe AI is going to play an increasingly significant role in that vision over the next few years and beyond.  
  
I would love to help you make sense of it 😊
