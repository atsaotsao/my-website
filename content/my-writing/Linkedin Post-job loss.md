There's been another round of tech layoffs these past few weeks:

  

Unity: 1,800 layoffs

Wayfair: 1650 layoffs

Google: 1,000 layoffs

Riot: 530 layoffs

Twitch: 500 layoffs

Discord: 170 layoffs

  

It bought me back to May 2020 when I got laid off.

  

Ever since I graduated, I've avoided unemployment like a plague, but I would have never imagined that unemployment could be one of my biggest teachers.

  

These are the 3 big lessons I've learned from unemployment:

  

1. The difference between being vs. doing

  

One of the biggest traps of living in a post-industrial or capitalistic society is that the world rewards doing.

  

I learned that I have spent the majority of my life doing rather than being.

  

Because of what my parents, school, and later of my jobs demanded of me, I prided myself as a doer. But when I stopped, it felt like I didn't know how to live anymore.

  

That was the push for me to learn to be. Through practicing mindfulness, I slowly learned to just be.

  

And in being, I learned that I am enough and deserve to be loved just the way I am, not because of the things I do.

  

2. The importance of slowing down

  

I learned that you need to slow down to go faster and farther. It's a paradoxical truth that bears repeating.

  

I've spent so many late nights, travels, and even weekends bent over my laptop with bad posture working, all because I wanted to do well.

  

And in doing well, I could be seen as valuable to the team and company. That meant that I could be one day promoted to the VP or even a Chief of Product.

  

But when I lost the job, not only was that plan completely derailed, but I realized that I had not been taking care of my mind and body.

  

I had put on a lot of weight and I started noticing a chronic back pain that wouldn't go away.

  

And where there was no longer work to occupy my mind, I noticed how it was always anxious, impatient, and restless.

  

It made me realize that life is a marathon, and if want to run farther, I have to prioritize self-care, practice doing things more slowly and intentionally, and utilize all the tools I can get my hands on to avoid burnout.

  

Since then, I have learned to be less attached to outcomes and to have stronger mental fitness when it comes to dealing with the uncertainties in life.

  

3. The pivot to entrepreneurship

  

After I started being and learned to slow down, I started to realize just how much space, time, and even safety I had.

  

I used the opportunity to journal and reflect on my thoughts, goals, ideas, and aspirations. I focused on the things I wanted because I wanted them and not because it's defined by a "should" from someone else.

  

It led to me take a chance on myself and started coaching, and ended up being the most fulfilling entrepreneurial path I could ever have imagined.
