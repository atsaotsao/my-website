I lost a coaching client early this week. 

This was the first time that a coachee told me that things just weren't working out and that we should stop working together. 

As someone who is running a coaching and building a coaching business all by myself, it was easy to have this narrative in my head: "I've failed. I screwed up bad and now I lost the trust of an individual AND an income stream."

There was part of me that wanted to say anything and everything to salvage this relationship and opportunity.

But a framework that I learned recently from the book *The Courage To Be Disliked* helped me pause, breathe, process, learn, and move on. It's called: "separation of tasks"

The idea is from [Alfred Adler's theory](https://www.simplypsychology.org/alfred-adler.html) of individual psychology and the gist of it is this: it's important to know when our tasks are and how they differ from tasks from others.  

I realize that I often become unhappy, distressed, confused and angry when I mix these responsibilities up. The biggest example of this is taking ownership of the task of managing someone else’s emotions or expectations. 

In this example of working with this client, by taking a second to pause and think, I realize that even though I have definitely made some mistakes, it was important to separate how she responded to them to how I react and how I feel it ties to my sense of self-worth and value.

The more I could separate the two, the more I am able to feel lightness resuming in my body, be in the headspace to extract all the key lessons from it so that I can improve, and ultimately keep going. 

Rejections are powerful curveballs that often packs a punch, but they always teach me so much — and I'm learning to listen.
