I signed a new coaching client this week. And afterwards, I felt so powerful and unstoppable that I wanted to move my body, and the first song that comes to mind is 2Pac's "Me Against the World." 

Recently I had just finished watching the documentary series "Dear Mama" on Hulu that tells the story Tupac and his mom, Afeni Shakur. It was an unbelievably powerful story that weaved together Tupac's life and tragedy as an rap artist, with the story of the black panther movement, which his mom was a big part of. Apart from understanding the root and sources of their traumas and anger, one thing I took away was both of their determination, perseverance, and confidence in achieving this bigger vision and dream that they had.

That is the kind of energy and mindset I'm learning to channel more in my life. And even though I'm not completely comfortable with my dancing and how it can be perceived, I've been learning to move ecstatically and authentically to how the music makes me feel and how I want to express those multitudes. 

Whatever emotions you are feeling, I hope you can also give ourself permission to move through it!
