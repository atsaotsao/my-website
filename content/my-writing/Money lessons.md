Today I want to talk about money

I want today to mark the start of me being more vulnerable around money. 

I have done some work already in my past working with my money traumas and money stories (unlearning the notion of seeing money as "bad") but there are still many parts of it that feels difficult that I have fears around it that I feel it deep in my bones.

Like some days I can feel my ancestral fears within me.

And I no longer want to keep it all within me. I have been learning to share that load with my partner, and I want to continue to speak openly about it, and I invite you to join in if this 

Here are 4 things I've learned on my money journey: 

1 - Money + Social Comparison = ☠️

2 - More money != more generosity / better vibes

3 - More self❤️ ➡️ more 💰

4 - There is such thing as ethical selling
