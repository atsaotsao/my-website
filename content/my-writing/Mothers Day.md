I've spent almost all of my mothers day in past 12 years away from home. 


Mother's day is the perfect day to practice gratitude for me. 

And it's not because this holiday tells me so with so much with the commercial incentives around getting gifts or purchasing experiences from the stream of ads and promotions

But because this day does provide me with an invitation to focus on one thing I will always always be grateful for, which is my vitality, the fact that I am here alive.

That even if there is so much chaos in the world right now, right here in this moment, the air that I breathe, the fact that I can have sounds virbrating out of my mouth to share my voice, how my hand is holding this microhpone, my feet standing being saftely held by the ground beneath me. I'm grateful.

Even in my darkest moments, even on days where I'm battling with my shadows and in the pits of pain and despair, I always come back to this OG source of gratitude. 

The gratitude of being born. However imperfect the environment and conditions it may be, it led me to here to be here with you. 

This one is for you mom. Thank you

Mother’s Day is the perfect day to practice gratitude for me.

And it’s not because this holiday tells me to.  
Not because of all the ads, the promotions, the commercial pull to buy gifts or book experiences.

But because this day offers an invitation—  
an anchor—  
to return to the one thing I’ll always, always be grateful for:

My vitality.  
The fact that I’m here.  
Alive.

Even with all the chaos in the world…  
right here, in this moment—  
I feel the air I breathe.  
I feel the sound vibrating out of my mouth, the warmth of my voice.  
The way my hand holds this microphone.  
The way my feet are safely grounded by the earth beneath me.

And I’m grateful.

Even in my darkest moments—  
when I’m deep in shadow,  
when pain and despair feel like they’re winning—  
I come back to this one, old, sacred truth:  
Gratitude for being born.

However imperfect the conditions.  
However flawed the environment.  
It all led to me being here.  
Alive.  
With you.

This one’s for you, Mom.  
Thank you.
