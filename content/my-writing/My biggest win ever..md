It's incredible intimidating to start anything. You can listen to all the pep talks, look through all the examples and inspirations, and even plan all you want, but when you're right at the edge of it, it's always scary to take the leap. That's how I'm feeling right now as I'm trying to come up with what to write for my first newsletter. 


Hello 👋

Welcome to the very first issue of *Andrew's Column*. I can't tell you how excited it is for me to get started writing and sharing with all of you!

For the longest time, I've been wanting to write and share more in long-form and consistently but there were always reasons, decisions, or questions that stopped me from moving forward. These were some of the questions that I struggled with: 
- Should I start a blog or a newsletter?
- Mailerlite vs. Convertkit, Substack vs. Beehiv, which tool should I use?
- What should I call it? What's an original name that no one has thought of?
- What should I write about?
- Should I make it a pure professional newsletter or can I include personal stories?
- How should I design it? How can I make it stand out in the sea of newsletters out there?
- What is a unique format I can include?
- Do I have something unique to offer to my readers?

Each time I try to start, I get paralyzed by not knowing the answers to all if any of these questions. 

But recently, after countless support I've received from everyone in the [BIPF fellowship](https://buildinpublicfellowship.com/), I've decided to give it a go and just simply start, and figure things out as I go. After building countless no-code experiments, and building a no-code coaching business, I learned that the best way to learn anything is to just start.

Here's are a list of things I plan to choose from to write about each week:
❤️ Personal stories with lessons and takeaways
✍🏻 Essays where I explore an idea or answer an overarching question
📚 Book reviews. I've been reading a lot lately (23 books this year so far) and I want to start sharing about the knowledge I've acquired and how it connects with how I'm learning to see the world
🛠️ Behind-the-scenes look at everything I'm doing, both wins and losses, as a solopreneur building a coaching practice
🧪 Any experiments, big or small, that I am planning to run

## Announcements:

This past Sunday, I had my biggest win all year, if not ever:
**💍 I got engaged!**

After 7 ½ years of being together, we finally made the leap and I can't wait to build a life with her:

I've had a lot of personal and professional accomplishment over the years, but my relationship with my partner, and now this big milestone, takes the cake as the thing I feel most proud of.
