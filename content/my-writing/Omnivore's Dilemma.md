 Ever since I read Michael Pollan's book *The Omnivore's Dilemma*, I've been even more intentional about thinking, eating, and most importantly how I prepare food. As someone who cares so much about efficiency and ease of use, it took a long time before cooking became an acquired skill and habit for me. In order for me to find a way to provide sustenance for myself and my partner while not being frustrated about how long it takes to prepare food, I resorted to finding a way to take as many shortcuts as possible It meant finding a good balance of frozen and fresh food. It included buying an air fryer to cook & grill some times items more quickly. It means finding the perfect recipes that take the least amount of effort. It also meant things like buying pre-chopped or even made items like shrimp and fish. But the book taught me that in order for me to understand the value of the food and be fully grateful for it, it's important to see the mortality of it as well. It's sometimes as simple as seeing a chicken getting chopped in front of you, and all the steps it takes before it becomes delicious chicken soup that nourishes the whole family. 

To me, I'm still finding weekly ways to practice this kind of intention and thinking. This week, I bought non-frozen shrimp for the first time and had to de-shell, clean, and prepare each shrimp individually for the first time ever it was humbling but I also feel like I am starting to understand the spiritual aspect in cooking the more I do it and better I'm becoming at it.
