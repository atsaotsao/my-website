Ways to decolincze spaces:
- provide more access to POC community
- Hire more POC facilitators
- Hire more facilitators with decolonized practices 



Value add:
- Album listening party
- A community lead who can lead these satruday sessions / welcome folks
- Newsletter / Podcast 
- comnmunity lead who can be the front person to make facilitators and members welcome 

- Membership model

"We streive to learn, socialize, and employ innovative and "forgotten methods for reversing monoculturization of mind, boyd, earth and ecnomy" quote from social


What does having decolinzed intentions means for ocmmunity:
- practices that actually encourage reciprocity
- Beyond connection, it's about safety
- Mechanisms that ensure it encourages access (like sliding scale)
- For the organizers not to use it as a advertising or billboard for future events (maybe? or like done right)
- For there not to be "outliers" who feel left out of cliques (is it community's responsibility?)
- Regardless what intention, for collective care not just to be named but felt 
- For a space to invite people to come as you are, not to perform, mask, socialize for hte sake of socializing, and even be put onto the spot 
- All nervous systems are acknowledged

### Chat GPT condensed:

**A decolonized community space should:**

- Cultivate **reciprocity**, not extraction
    
- Prioritize **safety**, not just connection
    
- Be **economically accessible**, e.g. through sliding scale, mutual aid
    
- Avoid becoming a **personal platform** for organizers unless that‚Äôs explicitly the container
    
- Reduce **clique dynamics** and foster relational inclusion
    
- Offer **tangible experiences** of collective care, not just aspirational language
    
- Welcome people in **non-performative ways**‚Äînot demanding charm, masks, or social fluency
  

> A truly decolonized community isn‚Äôt built on events, content, or visibility‚Äîbut on **relational integrity**.  
> It‚Äôs a space where **all nervous systems can breathe**, where contribution is **honored not extracted**, and where **belonging is practiced**‚Äîespecially for those who feel least seen in dominant spaces.  
> The values aren‚Äôt just named in a mission statement‚Äîthey are **felt in the pauses, the invitations, the repair, the way we say hello and goodbye.**


### üïäÔ∏è What might you be sensing but not yet naming?

Here are a few layered elements that may help you give shape to that invisible texture:

#### 1. **Energetic Hierarchies**

Even in ‚Äúnon-hierarchical‚Äù spaces, subtle power dynamics show up. Who gets listened to? Who gets centered? Who gets to be quiet without being invisible?

> **Decolonized care** asks: How are we holding each other in a way where power isn‚Äôt invisible or unspoken‚Äîbut actively softened, redistributed, or invited into mutuality?

#### 2. **Spaces of Belonging vs. Spaces of Visibility**

Not all ‚Äúinclusive‚Äù spaces are spaces of **belonging**. Inclusion often means: _You‚Äôre allowed to enter._  
Belonging means: _You‚Äôre already part of the fabric, and your presence matters._

> **Decolonized spaces** are not just open‚Äîthey _adjust_ to welcome.

#### 3. **Pace of Presence**

Colonialism is fast, extractive, goal-driven.  
A decolonized space honors the **pace of presence**. That might look like:

- time to land
    
- time to process
    
- space for silence or slowness
    
- fewer activities, more being-with
    

> **Is this space built for _bodies_ and _hearts_, or for optics and outcomes?**

#### 4. **Relational Infrastructure**

Many community events lack the invisible scaffolding of **relational practice**: check-ins, consent cues, repair rituals, clear exit/entry points.

> Decolonized spaces _don't assume_ we know how to be with one another‚Äîthey **practice** it.

#### 5. **Multiplicity, not cohesion**

Colonial norms push for cohesion and sameness: "We're all here for the same thing!"  
But a liberatory space allows for **contradiction, multiplicity, and difference without rupture**.

> Can people be in different emotional or spiritual places and still be held?

## üõ† RELATIONAL SCAFFOLDING: PRACTICAL ELEMENTS

### 1. **Check-in & Check-out Rituals**

> Creates a relational field from the start and helps people _arrive_.

**Examples:**

- ‚ÄúName, how you‚Äôre arriving, and one thing you‚Äôre letting go of before we begin.‚Äù
    
- ‚ÄúOn a scale from 1‚Äì10, how full is your cup today?‚Äù
    
- ‚ÄúA word to describe the energy you‚Äôre bringing in.‚Äù
    
- End with a simple round: ‚ÄúWhat are you taking with you?‚Äù or ‚ÄúOne word to close.‚Äù
    

### 2. **Consent Cues and Agency Prompts**

> Allows people to stay in relationship with their own needs and boundaries.

**Examples:**

- ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre always welcome to pass.‚Äù
    
- ‚ÄúI‚Äôll offer a few ways in, and you can choose what feels right to your body.‚Äù
    
- Before touch/movement: ‚ÄúIf physical contact is part of this practice, please check in with your partner first.‚Äù
    
- Give options: ‚ÄúYou can share aloud, in the chat, or just reflect silently.‚Äù
    

### 3. **Relational Agreements (not Rules)**

> Sets the tone for shared values in a co-owned space.

**Examples of agreements to co-create or name:**

- _Practice deep listening before responding._
    
- _Honor pacing‚Äîyour own and others‚Äô._
    
- _Speak from the 'I'._
    
- _Notice patterns of taking space or holding back._
    
- _Honor confidentiality and shared stories as sacred._
    
- _Mistakes are welcome‚Äîrepair is part of our practice._
    

Make space for people to _add their own_ agreements or needs.

### 4. **Soft Entry and Exit Points**

> Gives people time to land and leave‚Äîreducing performance pressure.

**Examples:**

- Gentle music or journaling prompts as people arrive.
    
- Solo grounding or sensory check-in to start.
    
- Invitations like: ‚ÄúCome in and take 5 minutes just to breathe or stretch.‚Äù
    
- A 10-min grace period at the beginning, labeled as ‚Äúsoft start.‚Äù
    

Exiting:

- ‚ÄúIf you need to leave early, please do so quietly when you need.‚Äù
    
- End with a grounding or community breath instead of a rushed goodbye.
    

### 5. **Affirming Multiple Ways of Participating**

> Validates those who aren't verbal or extroverted.

**Examples:**

- "You don‚Äôt have to turn your camera on to be present."
    
- "If words aren‚Äôt your way today, feel free to draw, move, or write."
    
- "We honor stillness as a form of expression."
    

Let people show up as _bodies_, not just as mouths and minds.

### 6. **Mid-Flow Consent & Regulation Checks**

> Maintains awareness of the group field.

**Examples:**

- ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs pause for a moment‚Äîhow‚Äôs everyone doing?‚Äù
    
- ‚ÄúIf this is feeling intense, take a breath or step away.‚Äù
    
- Offer breaks, water, or movement regularly.
    
- Use emojis or gestures for non-verbal check-ins (hands over heart, thumbs up, etc.)
    

### 7. **Repair as Cultural Practice**

> Normalize ruptures and reweaving.

**Examples:**

- ‚ÄúIf anything felt off or charged, let‚Äôs make space to tend to it‚Äîthis is a space for honesty and care.‚Äù
    
- Include an anonymous reflection or feedback form.
    
- Host regular ‚Äúcommunity tending‚Äù circles for shared accountability and listening.'




Hi Lola, 

I was recently at the first Second Saturdays at Reforesters think I saw you! We've only briefly met at David's C3 event last May (attached the photo in case you didn't remember) and it was a nice suprise to learn that you are one of the collaborators for that space. How are you? 

I wanted to reach out because I've attended a handful of Reforesters event so far and have really enjoyed the programming and especially the space (the 26 speakers set up seriously is magical for an audio lover like me ‚ú®). And it was during some of the conversations I've had with folks at hte event that made me think the community here and about how I would love more people to know and experience the space. 

A little about me: I am a life & creativity coach who has a deep spiritual practice and have always wanted to make certain welnness and healing modalities more accesssible, especially to more communities that need it the most. I am currently in the season of wanting to bring my community building & facilitation skills to supports IRL spaces that brings aliveness into our world. I wasn't sure if Reforesters is looking for more collaborators at the moment and just wanted to see if you're open to chatting?
