It's been a huge goal of mine for a long time to be able to share something I created myself on Youtube and on Spotify. 

And this week I plan to achieve both of them. 

I am absolutely so excited to share with you that I am launching the first ever episode of my podcast Joy of Building in a few days and I can't wait for the world to watch & listen to it. 

In the past few months, I have realize that I could no longer ignore my potential. I discovered that there was an inner child who wanted to express more, be more comfortable on camera, connect with more human beings, and most importantly to find a medium where he can channel his creativity and curiosity. 

Since then I've interviewed 3 incredible creators and founders and I'm just getting started. 

I am also planning to share more about the journey of starting a podcast from scratch.
