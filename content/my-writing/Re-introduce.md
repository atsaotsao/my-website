👋🏾 Allow me to reintroduce myself, my name is Michelene. I'm a community builder based in Brooklyn. I'm building my first company, Openspace, a coworking and community space.  
  
While I'm building Openspace, I'm open to work with a couple of select, new clients who need help building community, content, and/or events. So if you or someone you know are aligned with who I am and my work, I'd love to chat - feel free to ping me.  
  
I’ve dipped my hand in many pots: community, curation, content, event production, brand partnerships, dirty dishes, and so much more. Basically, I'm a super generalist. But the consistent thread of my work can be summed up very simply — I bring great people together.  
  
Over the last 7 years I’ve brought incredible creatives, women, and business leaders together. I've done this at The Wing, Round, and across VC firms in platform.  
  
A brief highlight reel  
⭐ I was the lead producer for Fiverr's recent International Freelancer Day.  
⭐At Round, I led community and content for a network of senior and executive leaders in tech.  
⭐At The Wing, I was part of an incredible brand partnerships team where I executed sponsor events for clients like Netflix, Showtime, and Saks Fifth Avenue. I also was our brand partnership team's unofficial talent researcher. I learned I'm great at finding emerging new voices.  
  
In my work, I’m most passionate about driving meaningful conversations, surfacing fresh talent, and expanding the table for underrepresented communities. And if you see underrepresented as a cuss word, this is where you should probably turn the tv off.



👋 Allow me to reintroduce myself, my name is Andrew. I’m a coach and artist based in Brooklyn. And I help people reclaim their artistry and creative powers so they can build lives and careers that actually feel like them.

And no, I’m not just talking to painters or musicians.

I’m talking to the high-achieving, soul-searching professionals out there who 






I spent the first 30 years of my life (I'm 33 now) focusing on my profession. 

I believed that if I finally got the job, salary that I wanted than I can finally feel like I can receive the respect, love, and acceptance that I so deeply crave. That I am worthy of those things. 

But when I learned to offer those things to myself, what surprised me was that the ambition of climbing to the top of the worlds soften, and what emerged is something I've decided to dedicate my lifetime to: 

The soul-filling and spine-tingling magic of seeing my own artistry, and all the beautiful ways it's can be expressed, be of service to others, and to build the kind of life and career that I have only dreamed of.

Artistry is not something you can simplify, label, and put in a box. 

It's something you can feel and I know you've felt it. 

It's not just about what happens when get moved by art, 

It's also about when you come across something or someone that you can feel that it's built, created, or deleivered with intentioan, integrity, and heart. 

It may be a mom & pop shop in your neighborhood.
It could be a specialized consultant that believes deeply in their work. 
It can someone you come across here on LI who writes beautifully.

Here's why the artistry is important:

- It sets you apart during a time dominated by AI
- It allows you to identify yoru competitive advantage and "zone of genius" that allows you to do things that best suited to your strengths
- It's what helps you connect most deeply to the inner parts of yourself that believes in yourself
- It has the power to not just make the kind of money you want, but inspire and move others in the process

And I want to be the kind of coach, teammate, ally, and cheerleader that supports people who wants to discover and be in their artistry.

Hot take: Your next level isn’t in a job title, a certification, or a better morning routine.

It’s in your artistry.

And no, I’m not just talking to painters or musicians.

I’m talking to the high-achieving, soul-searching professionals out there who are secretly tired of climbing ladders that go nowhere.

👋 I’m Andrew.

I’m a coach and artist based in Brooklyn. And I help people reclaim their creative power so they can build lives and careers that actually feel like them.

Here’s the truth:

For the first 30 years of my life, I was chasing all the right things.

The job, the salary, the validation.

Because I believed then I’d finally feel worthy.

But here’s what no one tells you:

You can succeed your way into burnout.

You can get everything you wanted—and still feel like a stranger to yourself.

What changed everything for me?

Realizing that I didn’t need another promotion.

I needed to remember who I was before I became so "professional."

That’s when I found my artistry.

Not just in what I create—but in how I think, move, listen, and lead.

And it’s what I help my clients discover, too.

Because artistry isn’t fluff. It’s fire.

🔥 It’s how you stand out in an AI world.

🔥 It’s how you tap into the part of you that’s confident without needing a pep talk.

🔥 It’s how you create a career that doesn’t just pay well—but feels good, too.

So here’s my question for you:

What does your artistry look like right now?

Have you buried it under productivity hacks and people-pleasing?

Drop a comment, even if it’s messy.

I wanna hear what this brings up for you.


Its beyond just seeing an artwork, listening to a song, or 

It's seeing 





I've been coaching full-time for over 4 years now (3 months in no-code coaching and 1 year in life & career coaching) and I've have at least a hundred conversation with folks who don't just feel stressed, but feel stuck, like they're at this point in their life where their soul wants to DO something, but they don't know what it is and what to do about it. 

It's a painful feeling.

I know because I've been in that similar place. 
One thing that depression teaches you is that the disconnection with yourself is the most painful experience.
