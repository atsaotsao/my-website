Last weekend I took a workshop where I got a chance to move my body while enjoying the scents of. plants through tinctures 

There was a moment where I was invited to place a drop of the tinctures made from magnolia on my tongue, swirl it around, and allow the sweetness of it the permeate my whole body

As I closed my eyes, I started getting these flashes of memories. I didn't remember any faces or scenes, but I could just feel the shapes and colors of youth. My youth or even my ancestors youth that have been forgotten but have been there in my body all along. 

I'm reminded of something I've read where according to the elders in indigenous communities, ceremonies like that are the ways we "remember to remember."

Whether we're moving our bodies, ingesting plants and food, imbibing in experiences and art , and even the mundane ways we start our days especially in an intentional ways, we are reminding ourselves to remember.

To remember all the invisible but beautiful & magical things within our memories, emotions, and most importantly the wisdom that's being stored deep in our bodies and the consciousness. 

And I'm still learning and practicing the art of remembering who I am. Especially who I am before the world told me who I should be. 

And boy, has that process been painful, liberating, isolating, rejuvenating, frustraingly-humbling, and ecstattically-joy bringing. And ultimately its making me feel more open, my life filled more love, and more connected than ever to the land that I rest on.

And I'm grateful. I'm grateful of where my journey has taken me. I'm grateful that you're here reading this. 

What would you like to remember more in your life? And how can that help you with where you want to go?

Last weekend, I took a workshop where I got to move my body while taking in the scent of plants through tinctures.

There was a moment when we were invited to place a drop of magnolia tincture on our tongues, swirl it gently, and allow its sweetness to spread through the body.

As I closed my eyes, flashes of memory began to surface. I didn‚Äôt see any faces or clear scenes‚Äîjust the feeling of youth. Shapes and colors, soft and familiar. Maybe my own memories. Maybe my ancestors‚Äô. Forgotten moments still living quietly in my body.

It reminded me of something I once read: in many Indigenous traditions, elders say that ceremony is how we remember to remember.

Whether we‚Äôre moving our bodies, tasting plants and food, soaking in art, or simply going about our daily rituals with intention, we‚Äôre inviting memory back into the room.

We‚Äôre remembering the invisible, the beautiful, the magical‚Äîour emotions, our dreams, and the deep wisdom that lives in the body and spirit.

I‚Äôm still learning how to remember who I am. Especially the version of me that existed before the world told me who I should be.

That process has been painful, liberating, isolating, rejuvenating, frustratingly humbling, and ecstatically joyful.

But through it all, I feel more open. My life is fuller. There's more love, more connection, and a deeper relationship to the land I rest on.

I‚Äôm grateful. Grateful for where this journey has led. Grateful that you‚Äôre here, reading this.

What would you like to remember more in your life?  
And how might that remembering help you find your way?
