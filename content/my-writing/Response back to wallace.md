Thank you for the kind words Andrew and thank you kindly for the condolences. It was very sudden and unfortunately I was only able to spend the last eight months or so caring for my father. I can't lie, everyday since has been a struggle.  
  
I have definitely cultivated proficiencies that are multidisciplinary and polymathic, but ever since exiting Horology, I have been very cautious as to who has access to them due to the inherent exploitation that takes place in most companies.  
  
As for the work that is calling... Man that's tough because I've always had a passion for things that generate enjoyment especially for children.  
  
I've been developing a children's kawaii character series/story that I hope to release sometime this year. I've also written a few outlines for some Hero films (miles morales, Gambit , and Blade).  
  
A ton of ideas in the tank, but I just haven't met the right people to team up with to bring them to the finish line and naturally I have my guard up about the "who".  
  
Curious, what prompted you to reach out to me of all folks and ask these specific questions?

I can really relate to the caution you mentioned. When I was let go of tech job in 2020, I also felt so exploited and betrayed. It was a healthcare startup dealing with the opiate epidemic, and I poured my heart and soul into that mission, job, and community. Being let go in the midst the pandemic was a curve ball that I didn't expect. At the same time, being there for my partner while she was dealing with a neck chronic pain was also extremely heavy and painful. 

But that was a huge turning point for me and the start of a lot of my self-love, transformaiton, and even healing journey. I had to slowly peel back layers after layers to understand why I attributed so much my self worth to the job and why losing it was so painful. And on this journey I utlized mindfulness, trauma-informed, and even somatic tools to help me heal from a lot of deep wounds I've carried all my life, get past a lot of limiting beliefs and mental barriers, and started to truly see the joyous and beautiful art that is my life. I started painting abstract art, sharing my light through content online, started a podcast, most importantly helping others to live a life that feels like art in motion- vibrant, intentional, alive. 

I started finding folks to reach out because I'm still trying to grow my coaching business and just want to expand my network and looks for folks who may be interested or may know someone they can refer me to. 

Base on what you've shared with me os far, I would love to connect via virtual call and explore if there is any way I can support you—whether it’s talking through your ideas & vision for this year, helping you move past roadblocks, or simply connecting you with someone in my network. Is that something you're interested in? 🙂
