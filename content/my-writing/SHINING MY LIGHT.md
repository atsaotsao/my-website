This is the first year I truly understood what it meant to harness one's inner light. 

When you are actively doing the kind of self-work that matters, you are noticing that tiny ember within you, and you are finally giving it the resources, the room and space, and even the permission to burn a little brighter.

And when you finally get to a place where you feel this light overflowing and you just can't hold it in anymore, that's when you can decide to share it, export it, and shine it as far as the eyes can see.

This light can repel others. It can feel too bright and too bold, and some will want to be as far away from it as possible. 

But the light can also attract. You will notice that it will draw in individuals who want are simply curious, who want to bask in it, and even show you their light. 

And that's the magic of it. 

It took me a while to realize  that the only thing we can focus on and have control over is this light. 

And life is all about this light and the lighthouse we build around it. 

So what does it take for you to believe in the power of your own light?
