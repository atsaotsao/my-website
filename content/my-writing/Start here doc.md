**"I want people to FEEL and relate, and allow it to be mirrors of themselves."**

**What is the emotional truth I want them to walk away with?**
I want them to know that it's okay to be sad, to be lost, to be in pain, to ltierally feel like you're at the edge and nothing matters, to feel so so alone. And to know that they matter, their inner light, love, artistry matters, and even though its scary, it's okay to listen to it. To act on it. To trust the inner compass even if it defies social expectations, rules, or even the rules of success that were imposed on them consciosusly or unconsiously. That they deserve that, and they have the ability to reconnect to all those beautiful parts of them. It's enver too late, and all it is to require soem intention, courage, and commitment to that path. 

hi, I‚Äôm Andrew.

You probably follow a lot of people on here‚Äîbut not everyone shares their story, or the deeper _why_ behind what they do.

So in the spirit of slowing down and getting to know each other a little better, here‚Äôs mine: a bit about where I‚Äôve been, and why this work means so much to me.

And if you feel like it, I‚Äôd love to hear a piece of _your_ story in the comments too..


about me

growing up, I always thought that I was a pretty happy kid. I came from a middle-class family, 

growing up, I could quickly tell how sensitive of a kid I was, especially when I'm hanging with other boys. For the longest time there was running joke about how I cried while watching 300 (there was a very herat-wrenching motivational speech somewhere in the film)

But I didn't know how 


growing up, I was a sensitive kid who loved 

I even felt lucky that I wasn't one of the asian kids with parents that had high expectations becoming a doctor, an engineer, or lawyer. 


growing up in Taiwan, I always knew that I was a sensitive kid. I cried a lot. There was an ongoing joke among my friends about me crying during an motivational speech during the movie 300. But I also laughed and joked around a lot, even if a lot those jokes were self-deprecating. I thought I was a pretty happy kid. I'm sure I was. 

But when I went to college in the states, where a perfect storm of events that included a breakup, roomate issues, homesickness and culture shock left me in state of spiraling downwards where I got closer and closer to my shadows. And I remember hitting that cliff's edge where the whisper of death floated in, and that scared the living shit out of me. I knew I lost but I didn't know how to ask for help. It took me years before I knew that what I was experiencing was depression. 

I could still remember how brutally painful everything was. 

One was the loneliness. I had so many days where I desperately wished someone would just randomly show up, knock on my door and check-in on me. 

Two was the disconnection with myself. I had chosen to live but I remember looking at the list of companies who were going to be there for my university' job fair and thinking to myself: "I am not interested in ANY of these jobs"

Fast forward to May 2020, by that point I had moved to NYC, worked a bartender, a door-to-door salesmen for oofice supplies, a luxury safe salees associate, and product manager in tech, but I didn't expect to be laid off from a job I had poured so much of myself to on a Friday, via zoom call, and right in the peak of pandemic. that was my second wake up call. 

I realized that at that moment, there was nothing in this world that was more important than understandng and connecting more deeply on myself. And taking a bet on myself to follow the inner compass to wherever he wants to surrender into.

To listen to to the deep love, light, creavitiy, and artistry that flows through every part of my being. 

I believe I was put on this earth to show fellow lost souls, wanderers, creatives, sensitive humans, and dreamers to connect more deeply and bet on themselves. To create the life and careers they haven't even begun to dream of.

So if you're new to my page or just stoping by...

thank you for being here. 

Thank you for support me and allow me to do this everyday. 

allowming to show up as myself and all teh multitudes I want to bring with me.

Keep going, my friends.

hi, I‚Äôm Andrew.

You probably follow a lot of people on here‚Äîbut not everyone shares their story or the deeper _why_ behind what they do.

So in the spirit of getting to know each other a little better, here‚Äôs mine: a bit of my story and why I do the work I do.

And if you feel like it, I‚Äôd love to hear a piece of your story in the comments too.

Growing up, I‚Äôve always been sensitive.

As a kid growing up in Taiwan, I cried easily. There‚Äôs still a joke among my friends that I once got teary during the movie _300_, during one of those over-the-top motivational speeches.
And it‚Äôs true. I did feel a lot. Deeply

But I also laughed hard. I made people laugh. I used humor‚Äîoften at my own expense‚Äîto stay connected. And for the most part, I really did think I was a happy kid.

And maybe I was.  
But I was also absorbing more than I knew how to hold.

When I moved to the States for college, a lot shifted and quickly. 
There was heartbreak. Roommate drama. Homesickness I didn‚Äôt know how to name.  
And slowly, I began to spiral‚Äîdownward and inward‚Äîuntil one day I found myself at the edge of something I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd ever get close to.

I still remember the whisper of it.  
The thought that maybe it would be easier to not be here.  
And I remember how much that scared me.

I didn‚Äôt know I was depressed‚Äî it took me years to even name it.
I just knew I felt disconnected. From the life I had imagined.  
Most painfully, from myself.

I remember staring at a list of companies coming to our university‚Äôs job fair and thinking,  
_I don‚Äôt want to work at a single one of these places._  
And wondering what that meant about me.

Years passed. I moved to New York.  
I lived a life that looked spontaneous from the outside‚Äîbartender, door-to-door salesman, luxury safe specialist, tech product manager.  
But I kept trying to shape myself into someone the world would take seriously. Someone who could belong.

Then, in May 2020, I was laid off from a job I had poured my heart into‚Äîon a Friday, via Zoom, at the height of the pandemic.

And that became my second wake-up call.

In the silence that followed, I made a choice:  
To stop betraying myself.  
To stop chasing paths I never chose.  
To get quiet. To get honest.  
To follow the part of me that I had pushed away‚Äîthe creative, tender, intuitive part.  
The part that always knew.

---

That choice led me back to myself.  
And back to the work that feels most alive for me.

Today, I‚Äôm a coach and an artist.  
I help people reconnect with who they really are‚Äî  
the version beneath the people-pleasing, the perfectionism, the pressure.

I support fellow deep feelers, creatives, wayfinders, and soul-driven professionals‚Äî  
especially those who‚Äôve wandered from path to path,  
who‚Äôve tried on different roles, identities, or careers,  
not because they‚Äôre lost, but because something deeper has always been calling them home.
Together, we navigate big transitions and build careers and lives that actually feel like _them_.

Not just impressive on paper.  
But alive. Expansive. True.

If you‚Äôre reading this and you‚Äôve been feeling lost, stuck, numb, or like you‚Äôve been living someone else‚Äôs version of success‚Ä¶

I want you to know it‚Äôs not too late.  
To reconnect. To rewrite. To return.

Thank you for being here.  
Thank you for allowing me to show up as I am, and do this work with so much heart.

You‚Äôre not alone.  
Keep going.

With love,  
Andrew üåÄ
