Richard Feynman taught me that curiosity can be a superpower.

Recently I finished reading the book _"Surely You’re Joking, Mr Feynman!”: Adventures of a Curious Character_ and I'm in awe of his insatiable curiosity and playful approach to learning and living.

It's through his curiosity that he finds so much joy in everything he does. And through embodying and leaning into the joy, he was able to become:
- A Nobel Prize winning physicist
- One of the most renowned educators 

While being someone who explored a diverse array of interests which included:
- playing the bongos
- Mayan heiroglyphics
- learning spanish, portugese, and japanese
- safecracking
- painting and sketching


Here's a quote and question from the book I implore you to think about:
> "What could be better than getting paid to make your own experiments?"
