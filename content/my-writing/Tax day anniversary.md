I find it funny that Tax Day falls on the same day as my anniversary.

This year, I’m celebrating 9 years with my partner, @Laureen.

And while many of you may be doing your taxes the very last minute (no shaming for procrostinator here),  I'm reflecting on how much my relationship has not just taught me about love but about the nature of doing hard things. 

A few weeks ago, we had a tough moment. 
The kind where even with the help of our couples therapist, we found ourselves sitting at home on the two corners of the kitchen table in silence, unsure how to bridge the space between us that kept getting wider and wider. 

And I can't exactly pinpoint what made this moment significant, but it felt like the first time I was invitied change my avoidant behaviors, and instead of of dashing to another room and closing the door to protect myself 

I chose to stay. 

I realized that the common thread of breaking the patterns that are keeping us stuck, unhappy, and scared is realizing that it's not about avoiding hard moments.  

It’s about staying—  
even when your nervous system is fried, your inner child is flaring up, and you’d rather shut down.

So yeah.  
Tax Day.  
One day a year we account for our finances.

Anniversary Day?  
A chance to reflect on the compounding interest of growth, tenderness, rupture, and repair.  

If you’re in a long-term relationship, you get it.  
It’s not about getting it right all the time.  
It’s about staying curious.

If any of you have a relationship story you'd like to share in the comments, I'd love to hear!

I find it funny that Tax Day falls on the same day as my anniversary.

This year, I’m celebrating 9 years with my partner.

And while many of you may be doing your taxes at the very last minute (no shame to the procrastinators here), I’m reflecting on how much this relationship has taught me. Not just about love, but about the nature of doing hard things.

A few weeks ago, we had a tough moment.  

The kind where, even with the help of our couples therapist, we found ourselves sitting at opposite corners of the kitchen table in silence, unsure how to bridge the space between us that kept stretching wider and wider.

And I can’t exactly pinpoint what made this moment significant, but it felt like the first time I was truly invited to change my avoidant behaviors.  
Instead of dashing to another room and closing the door to protect myself—

I chose to stay.

I realized that the common thread in breaking the patterns that keep us stuck, unhappy, and afraid...  
isn’t avoiding the hard moments.

It’s about staying,
even when your nervous system is fried, your inner child is flaring up, and you’d rather shut down and play 9 rounds of Smash Bros to prove you still have control over something. (Just me?)

So yeah.  
Tax Day.  
One day a year we account for our finances.

An anniversary?  
A chance to reflect on the compounding interest of growth, tenderness, rupture, and repair.

If you’re in a long-term relationship, you get it.  
It’s not about getting it right all the time.  
It’s about staying curious.

I know LI isn't the kind of space for relationship stories, but if you've got one today that you'd want to share in the comments today, I'd absolutely love to hear it!
