Today I’ve picked a new book to read called [_The Art of Gathering_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37424706-the-art-of-gathering). It was the type of book I don’t think I would ever buy in a bookstore or order from Amazon, but it became part of my library simply due to my habit of collecting books from the streets of Brooklyn. People often throw out books they don’t read anymore and it became the perfect source of encountering books that’s out of my radar. And I’m so glad I did.

I’ve always been drawn to the idea of making gatherings more meaningful. Being an extrovert in a city like New York, I’ve had my fair share of gatherings and I’ve experienced a range of the best to the worst, and I’ve always wondered to myself why some gatherings make me come home with so much disappointment? I learned about a term that derived from Japanese tea ceremonies which states, “ichi-go ichi-e” which translates to “once in a lifetime.” It refers to the importance of gathering we take part in because the rare moment that people are together in the same place can never be replicated the same way again because people change and therefore every gathering is always a once-in-a-lifetime experience.

This year I’ve learned more and more about the importance of intentionality of everything we do; in cleaning, in the things we own, in the space, we carve for ourselves and others, and the time we spend. I can’t wait to learn more about being more intentional with hosting gathering, so that I can apply that to my own.
