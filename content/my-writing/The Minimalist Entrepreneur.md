 I just finished reading Sahil Lavingia's recent book *The Minimalist Entrepreneur* and I feel very validated in the vision for creating a life that's focused on creating a minimalist and sustainable life for myself and my loved ones. Ever since I read his Medium essay, ["Reflecting on My Failure to Build a Billion-Dollar Company"](https://sahillavingia.com/reflecting) soon after I was laid off from my job in the midst of pandemic and starting to think about what being an entrepreneur would look like, and I felt like finally, I am reading about someone talking about why a VC-financed business shouldn't be the goal for everyone. He talked openly about the struggles of working in a world where "growth at all cost" mentality is the norm and where everyone is chasing after being a unicorn and the side-effects of that. 

For me, the negative aspects of a VC-funded business are also a personal one for me during my two and half years of working at a healthcare startup. I was able to witness firsthand how the expectation of growth, revenue, and the failure to meet those expectations can lead to a company abandoning culture, and treating people as disposable parts of running a business, and I was unfortunately on the losing end of the deal. Since then, it made me think about how I can create change, to generate profit, but most importantly, to create good in this world at a scope that is sustainable and scalable.

I want to be a minimalist entrepreneur, who focuses on the right things and one day have my business grow just for me to continue to be the most authentic me. I also love that during these years where Sahil reevaluated his priorities, it also sounded like he founded a love for practicing and sharing his creativity in forms of painting and writing. That's something I aspire to as well.
