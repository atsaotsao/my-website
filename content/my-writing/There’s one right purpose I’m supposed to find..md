"There’s one right purpose or path I’m supposed to find."

YOU DONT HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT ANYMORE. 

This one story we tell ourselves is one of the reasons why so much of us feel so stuck, stressed, and feel trapped, especially when it comes to our career or our life.

### 🎬 **REEL SCRIPT: “You Don’t Have to Believe That Anymore”**

**(With 'Resume Scroll' 5-Second Moment)**

---

**🎯 Hook:**

> “There’s one right purpose or path I’m supposed to find.”  
> **YOU DON’T HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT ANYMORE.**  
> This belief is one of the reasons so many of us feel stuck, stressed, and trapped—especially when it comes to our careers or our lives.

---

**📍 Context (Before mindset):**

> I used to think if I didn’t find my _one true calling_, I’d fail at life.  
> That every step in my career had to make sense, follow a clear arc, and build toward some kind of peak.  
> And I think many of us believe this because success is often framed as linear—  
> a ladder, a pipeline, a track.  
> So we chase the perfect story. And when our real life doesn’t fit that shape… we panic.

---

**🕰 5-Second Moment (The resume scroll):**

> I was once updating my resume and found myself deleting entire chapters of my life.  
> Not because they weren’t meaningful—but because they didn’t fit the narrative.  
> That’s when it hit me:  
> I was trying to shrink myself to fit a story I didn’t even believe in anymore.

---

**💡 Internal Realization (Shift in mindset):**

> That moment changed everything.  
> I realized my purpose isn’t a polished LinkedIn headline.  
> It’s the _throughline_ underneath it all—my curiosity, my creativity, my care.  
> What I do can evolve. My artistry stays constant.

---

**📣 Call to Action (Summarize + inspire):**

> So if you’re in the middle of a pivot, don’t erase the messy parts.  
> Don’t delete your complexity.  
> You’re not lost—you’re just too expansive to be reduced to one label.

Ever try to write a “perfect” career narrative?  
Delete a chapter of your life because it didn’t fit?  
Yeah, me too.  
This post is about what I found in that moment—and why I stopped looking for _one_ right path.
