boxoflove:: Been going on a similar path - wishing you solace and success

boxoflove:: We need to take care of ourselves first sometimes and ask ourselves what WE need. This is the kind of reminder I love to see

boxoflove:: Meditation saved my life. It was the very beginning of profoundly changing myself and life.

boxoflove::  I gotta figure out who in their right mind repeatedly said “I hate you” to a small child (me). Cause I can’t remember

boxoflove:: A song will come on from the beginning of my healing journey and I’ll hear it and it’ll take me back but also so show me how far I’ve come. Sometimes I’ll get goosebumps, sometimes I’ll cry happy tears. Music can be so powerful in that way.

boxoflove:: i find your journey meaningful. what you have done and do has brought real value to me.

boxoflove:: I needed this

boxoflove:: I almost have no words for what I feel witnessing your extreme vulnerability, and your immense courage. I sensed your sincerity. So many feel or have felt the same things as you and hide it all behind the smile. I applaud you for being brave enough to break down the walls of fear and shame that society has created about these aspects of being human. The fact that you were willing to push past your fear and allow yourself to be SO vulnerable, especially for a male in our society, shows how serious you are about healing and true growth. And along with your own growth, you could have saved a life! Thank you. I found it very inspiring.

boxoflove:: We are our biggest cheerleaders

boxoflove:: This is how I love you the most and you love yourself the most

boxoflove:: hope my teen version wouldn’t be too disappointed to see me

boxoflove:: Some of the loneliest times of my life I was still surrounded by people

boxoflove:: That’s powerful and sheer beauty my friend

boxoflove:: My prayer is that my daughter finds her creativity again. Some person(s) have told her certain things that is stuck in her head. I want her to see her own value

boxoflove:: Choosing love, time and time again

boxoflove:: thanks for reminding us to stay true to ourselves
