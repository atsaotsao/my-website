Twice a day on almost every Friday, I will always hear my colleagues say "Happy Friday" to me then follow-up with some comments about "being glad that the week is finally over." Why do we often praise Friday for being the savior of our weeks? Don't get me wrong, I like Fridays as much as the next person; today after work I got to fill my stomach with delicious gourmet grilled cheese and mushroom & sauerkraut pierogies, then fill my soul with the beautifully adapted film "Little Women", but I think we should treat every day like it's Friday.

On Friday, we feel excited about what lies ahead. We picture ourselves having dinner with our friends and families, or at a concert pumping our fists and shaking our butts. or sleeping in, feeling warm and content under our bedsheets. I try to approach every day with that kind of mentality. I think about the next day and all the exciting things I am going to enjoy, all the food I'm going to eat, all the exciting new things I get to indulge in. Treat every day like it's Friday; if my cat can do it, why can't I?
