I am feeling scared today but I am feeling less scared than I was in 2016.

In 2016, I remember staying up till 3 am to watch the election results at a bar near Union Square in NYC. 

When I learned that Trump won back then, I just broke down and cry.

I didn't care that other patrons were staring at me.
I didn't care that I had a work meeting at 10 am in the next morning, and still had an hour commute back to my Brooklyn home.

I knew that I just needed to grieve at that moment. 

Looking back I knew that I was scared because I felt powerless.

I felt powerless because I couldn't do anything. 

I didn't understand politics and the only thing I felt like I could do is make a choice between two options every four years.
I didn't understand the systems of power at play, and how they could impact the communities that I don't interact with on a day-to-day basis.
I didn't understand what it meant to rebel, speak up, organize, and to keep building.

I also didn't understand how all of this is connected to individual work, and what it means to find peace and liberation within my own self.

It was hard to admit to myself that I didn't want to understand those things.

And I am using this opportunity today to remind myself that I am no longer that same person.

I want to celebrate that I feel less scared because I no longer feel powerless in the face of these challenges anymore.

I can tune into my body, and invite it to grieve, rage, and even move and dance through what it wants to.
I can invite and check-in on all my parts, and remind all of them that no matter what happens, I will be with them every step of the way.
I have allies I can turn to process together, and brainstorm how we can continue show-up and co-create what we want to see in this world 


Crisis like these are designed to make us feel powerless.

To make us want to hide, run, distract, avoid, and even find people, things, situations to blame.

But it's also in these moments that reminds us just how powerful we are.
That we are way more resilient than we sometimes give ourselves credit for. 

That we also have so much more capacity grow, expand, and love.
And the more we pay more attention to our internal balance & alignment, the more we can see clearly the delicate balance in our external world and how to be a part of restoring it.

If any of this resonate with you, please leave a comment below. I would love to hear how you are doing and what you are scared or even optimistic about. 

And if you need someone to talk to about anything, please don't hesitate to reach out via DM.

Keep going, my friend ‚ù§Ô∏è
