For your first version, it’s important to ask yourself: “what is the most simplest version of this thing that I can build and ship, that will help me invalidate my riskiest assumption?”

I’ve been coaching no-code for more than 700 hours now, here’s 5 common mistakes I’ve learned: 



No-Code Starter Tip: 

Good builders can learn to put their perfectionist side down


Note to self:

Focus on the direction not the speed of where I'm going


No-Code Starter Tip:

If you're having difficulty coming up with an idea to work on, think about the niche you want to focus on. 

Ask yourself these questions:
- Are you aware of the niche?
- Are you interested in the niche?
- Have you found interesting problems in the niche?
- Have you seen signs from the niche of interest to pay for solutions?
- Have you found that the niche is big enough for your business?



No-Code Starter Tip:

Create automations to help yourself become more creative.

The goal of automating your tasks isn't to eliminate all tasks, but rather to take care of the basic needs, so that we can focus on what really matters (and what is more fun): to create more.

Ask yourself this question: what is one way automation can make my life easier every day?


No-Code Starter Tip:

Building stuff is fun, but don't ever forget the super important step of talking to the audience or your users.

Tools built with no-code is most powerful when you combine the speed & ease of development with how often and effective you are with getting iterative feedback.

So ship it, and ask questions!


No-Code Starter Tip:

Every good product always starts with good conversations and even better questions. 

Learn to ask powerful questions that uncovers the real pain and problems that people have that you want to solve for.

My coaching business have been a humbling experience of market validation. 

Before 2021, I am not even really truly aware of what a coach does and why someone would pay for the services. I had never worked with a coach, and no one in my vicinity have either. 

At the same time, newly armed with skillsets to build products with no-code, I wanted to become a maker, indie-hacker, founder who could create a living building and selling products. 

But I was struggling. I wanted to build [LlamaText](https://llamatext.com/) but couldn't figure out how to do it. And that introduced a lot of shame and doubt. I remember saying to myself: "maybe I'm not cut out for this. Maybe I should just consider interviewing for PM jobs again."

But at the same time, I was still always incredibly passionate about no-code and the potential it has. I would often offer and advice to anyone who asked. Mostly because I was constantly brimming with excitement to talk about these tools and how much joy they have bought me.




>You can’t ever reach perfection, but you can believe in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving

[draw on excalidraw]


The most powerful aspect about a solopreneur is being humbled every day by the skills I don't have but want to have the mindset to ceaselessly strive to be better.

In addition to being a better coach and builder.

I am learning to be better at:
- Selling 
- Marketing
- Writing
- Managing finance

 Idea in essence has zero value,
-   "Idea isn't worth anything"

Building a good automation is an art.

Here are 4 essential parts you should have:

1.  jobs to be done
    -   mExample: When a new client signs their docusign agreement, I need to set up a new project folder structure in Google Drive then upload their signed document, create a new project channel in Slack, schedule their kickoff meeting, and send out a meeting, and send out a welcome email with the Google Calendar invite.
    -   blue for tools
    -   Green for "verb"
2.  trigger
3.  actions
4.  report


No-Code Starter Tip:

When you're feeling stuck, and you've already spent hours crawling through forums and videos to figure out something, sometimes it's okay to take a step away, take a walk or even sleep on it, then look at it again with fresh eyes.
