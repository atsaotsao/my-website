**I visited my grandparents a few weeks ago.**  
I visit them at least once every two years, but this time it felt different.

In the past, visiting their graves was the only way I knew how to connect with them. But this time, it felt like saying hi to old, familiar friends.

This shift, I realized, was due to my Ancestor practice.


**What is Ancestor Practice?**  
Growing up, I was accustomed to rituals for honoring my ancestors.

On Chinese New Year or **Qingming Festival** (Tomb-sweeping day), my family would often travel early in the morning to visit graves, plaques, or altars. With incense in hand, I‚Äôd bow three times, make a heartfelt request, and bow again.

If I‚Äôm honest, I often just went through the motions.

But as I‚Äôve grown older, I‚Äôve realized these rituals hold wisdom‚Äîtools for navigating uncertainty and staying resilient.

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned through my practice:


**1) Why do it?**
Ancestor practice is a way to ask for help‚Äîfrom our mental, spiritual, and even emotional support systems.

In the past, when life felt uncertain, I‚Äôd cope by holding on tighter to everything and everyone around me‚Äîcontrolling every aspect I could to feel safe.

Now, I aim to let go. To loosen my grip and surrender, even when life feels overwhelming. 
Ancestor practice reminds me that I don‚Äôt have to face uncertainty alone; I can lean on unseen support.

**2) What does support feel like?**  
When I transitioned from tech to becoming a coach and an artist, I could feel how being more aligned with my soul made my heart felt fuller than ever‚Äîbut it was also absolutely terrifying. My bank account and sense of security took a hit, making me question just about everything in my life.

During those times, my practice gave me the grounding I needed on stormy days. It reminded me of my roots and gave me a sense of belonging and continuity. 

Sometimes during this ancestor practice, I could even feel a warmth spreading from the base of my spine all the way to my shoulders‚Äîlike having pairs of hands gently places on me reminding me, "we've got your back."

Support and sensations like this reminds me that I‚Äôm never truly alone. That I‚Äôm part of something greater‚Äîan unbroken lineage of resilience.


**3) How can you start an Ancestor practice?**  
There‚Äôs no right or wrong way to connect with your ancestors. This practice can be as simple or elaborate as you choose. Here‚Äôs what works for me:

- **Create a quiet space**: Set up an altar, light a candle, or simply sit in stillness. Choose a setting that feels sacred to you.
- **Ground yourself**: Take a few deep breaths, or use a meditation or grounding exercise to center your mind and body.
- **Invite them in**: With intention, welcome your ancestors into your space. Speak their names, hold an object that reminds you of them, or visualize their presence.
- **Ask for help**: Open your heart. Share your challenges, fears, and intentions. Be honest about what you need.
- **Trust that you‚Äôre heard**: Even if you can‚Äôt sense a response immediately, know that the connection exists.
- **Express gratitude**: End with a simple thank you‚Äîgratitude completes the circle of connection.

Ancestor practice is about fostering a relationship with your roots and the unseen world. It‚Äôs about tapping into a deep well of wisdom and resilience so you can experience the joys and gifts of your lineage.


This is your reminder: You‚Äôre never alone.

**What does it mean to connect with your ancestors?** üåø

I used to think it was just about rituals‚Äîvisiting graves, lighting incense, bowing. But over time, I‚Äôve discovered it‚Äôs so much more.

Ancestor practice has become a quiet anchor in my life. A way to feel supported, to ask for help, and to tap into the resilience of those who came before me.

I visited my grandparents few weeks ago. I visit them at least once every two years but this time it felt different. 

In the past it felt like the only way I can say hi to them was to visit their graves, this time around I felt like saying hi to old familiar friends. 

And I realize that it felt different because of my own Ancestor practice. 


Growing up, I'm used to the rituals of paying tribute to my ancestors. 

On Chinese New Year, or Ching ming jie (day of the dead), I remember the familiar travels often very early in the morning where I would travel afar to see where the dead is buried. 

Sometimes it involves a tombstone, a plaque, other times an altar. 

I would hold an stick of incense, go forward to bow three times, ask from my heart a few things I want in life, bow again, then that's that. 

If I were completely honest, most time I was going through the motions.

But my Ancentor practice has taught me that this ritual, and what we can extract from it, can give me additional tools to navigate the turbulence and uncertainties in life. To help me stay resilient

1) Why do it?
Because I need help. We all need help. 

I recognize that I can always use more mental, spiritual, and even financial help. 

In times of uncertainty, I knew in the past that I can get through it by grower tighter, by holding onto and controlling things in my life so that I can give myself the feeling of security and stability. 

But I don't want to show up that way anymore. 

And I recognize that to loosen, to let go, and even surrender even when there are so much moving parts around me, that I need as much support from around me and the realm beyond us. 



2) What the support feels like?



Ever since I've leaped into becoming a coach and artist instead of working in tech, I notice how much fuller my heart is. But in the short term, I also notice how it impacts my bank acount and my abilities 



3) How to do it

Ancestor practice is a spiritual practice that can but doesn't have to look like anything else.
