Last night I finished watching Arnold Schwatezznager documentary on Netflix and it made me think about the power of visualization. 

It reminded me that all the high-performers and high-achievers whom   draw inspiration from, either in sports or in entrepreneurship, all have strong practice of visualizing themselves accomplishing something. The more the visualize, and recall that visualization, the more they believe. The more they believe, the more they manifest it. 

Here's an exercise I would like you to try with me today. What's something you want to accomplish by the end of this quarter. Now visualize it in your mind with as much clarity as possible. Then to help remind you to recall this visualization, whats an easy way to have something to remind you to recall this visualization on a daily basis. It can be a sticky note, a note on the fridge, or even your phone wallpaper. 

Good luck and I'll see you around!
