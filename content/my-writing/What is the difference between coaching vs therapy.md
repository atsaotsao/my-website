Today I was asked during a coaching intro call: "What is the difference between coaching vs. therapy?"

I didn't like the answer I gave so after the call ended, I thought more about my experiences working with both and wanted to share my thoughts on it.

And so here are 5 areas life coaching is different than therapy:


1/ Past vs. Future

A coach looks at your present to help you create the future you desire

While a therapist looks at your past to help you manage your present


2/ Diagnosis vs Cocreation

A coach is always cocreating a solution with the coachee through active questioning, mirroring, and facilitation to help the coachee tap into his/her inner wisdom 

While a therapist's role is diagnosis and treating underlying issues.


3/ Patient <> Doctor relationship vs. equal

In coaching, both client and coach are considered equal, there is no hierarchy or anyone knows better

In therapy, it's a patient who needs treatment to a doctor offering that treatment

4/ Non-goal-oriented vs. Goal-oriented

In coaching, a client always encouraged at every call to move forward and make baby steps toward that life goals that impact all areas of life.  

In therapy, the focus is more often on supporting understanding and increasing the level of clarity of the past and how to heal from the traumas.

5/ Licensed vs. unlicensed

In coaching, most coach are not licensed (although can receive credentials) but that sometimes means that good coaches can draw from a lot camps of knowledge and approaches to tailor an action plan for their clients

In therapy, all practitioners are licensed are usually trained in a specific method or camp of knowledge

6/ Personal vs Both Personal & Professional topics

With a coach who you are comfortable with, you can talk about personal issues, emotions, and how it relates to the goals you've set for yourself, but also about more technical things that is relevant to your industry or work.

With a therapist, many clients find it harder to explain technical problems to them such as something more specific to working in tech.
