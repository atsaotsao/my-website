This past Sunday I decided to spend 24 hours without any internet.

The intention was simple: 
I wanted to see what I would do, how I would feel, and overall how I would navigate 24 intentional hours at home without any wi-fi or data. 

I also had prepared a list of things to have, just in case I ran out of things to do:
- A handful of albums downloaded on Spotify
- Two movies downloaded on Netflix
- Art supplies 
- A new book I'm just starting called The Map of Consciousness
- Leftover food I have from the night before

Then, I set an alarm on my iPhone for 23 hours 59 minutes and 59 seconds (apparently this is the maximum amount of time you can set for a timer) and started this spontaneous 24-hour challenge for myself.

I wish I could tell you everything went smoothly and steady, that as someone with a daily meditation and mindfulness practice, that every moment of stillness and quietness was deeply meaningful.

The reality was that there were parts that were extremely uncomfortable, especially near the beginning. 

There were moments when I was sitting in my living room floor and looking out at the apartment and feeling, from head to toe, just *bored*. 

There were also other moments where I experienced first world problems around the inconvenience of not being able to rely on internet powered tools or systems anymore.

Like asking Alexa to turn on a specific set of lights. 

Or trying to Airplay the movie I downloaded on my phone to my Roku sound bar (somehow completely forgot that Airplay requires Wi-fi as well).

Or being able to look up something I really wanted answers for (I was thinking about Mazlov's heirarchy of needs and wanted to do some research around it)

But the more I sat with the feelings, the more I realized how important these moments were. 

And the more I leaned into it and swam in the discomfort, the more I was able to realize the importance of this experiment.

Here are 3 things I learned from this 24-hour challenge: 

1] How difficult it is to BE vs. DO

I've shared before about learning the difference between being vs. doing after I lost my job and became unemployed.

It's been 4 years since I've worked at a full-time job and have since been an entrepreneur, but I still notice just how incredibly challenging it is to lean into just BEING.

When I was sitting there, staring out at the distance, I could feel literal synapses in my brain trying to pull me in all these directions of DOING.

They're telling me to: 
- Be productive and work on my coaching business
- Get up and move my body, to make better use of the time and squeeze in a workout
- To acquire more knowledge by reading any one of the 4 books I'm currently alternating in between
- To call someone up to chat and catch up

In addition to that, any time I opened up my phone, I was constantly getting reminders that the Wi-fi was down. 

It felt like these devices were also yelling at me to get back to a world and mode that was familiar and comfortable. 

Even when I opened my laptop, wishing to jot down a few notes about my experience thus far, I gotten a similar reminder:

The hardest part was knowing that the internet was only one click away on my phone.  

And that's when it clicked in my brain. 

Not only do I have an emotional and chemical reliance on how the internet allowed me to do things and make me feel

I also realize that the world we live in, the innovations all around us, are all mostly built to encourage a dominant narrative: our sense of worth and value is tied to what we do in this world. 

If you take a second to really sit with that thought, how does that make you feel?

Does it feel fair that we are measured with this scale? 
Does it feel fair that certain sex, ethnic groups, socioeconomic class, communities with disabilities, or even age groups can be perceived as lesser than because of the certain specific output and outcomes that are being measured to determine their role in our world?

While thinking about all this, I felt strongly for the first time that this *boredom* was important and trying to teach me something. 


2] Being bored is good for us 

I used to take pride in saying that I never feel bored. 

I could honestly fill my days with 30 minute increments of a whole variety of activities and never have to feel the pang of boredom kick in. 

But that's also part of the problem. 

Because when you are bored, and you no longer lean into your usual patterns of distractions and bypassing, your mind will naturally look inward to unearth what is something that you really want to do or explore.

You will tap into this inner voice in you that calls upon you to lean into something, however spontaneous, unnatural, and uncomfortable it may seem. 

For me, after just sitting there for at least 2 hours, I just started asking myself honestly: "What is is that you really want to do at this moment?"

And I heard the inner part of myself speak up. 

It was in whispers, but I could hear it very clearly because of how much noise I removed around me.

It led me to:
- Go on a run around Prospect Park, even though the weather was horrid outside
- Draw and experiment with watercolor, which I had never really done before
- Jam out on my piano
- Dug through my storage to get out my guitar to play my old favorites

Ever since I heard that inner voice, it felt like each activity I did was EXACTLY what I needed to do and they felt so nurturing to my body and soul.

3] Connection is complex

I don't know about you, but as a kid from the 90s who experienced the evolution of the internet and social media (from myspace all the way to Tiktok now)

For me, the promise of these platforms and the internet in general in helping us feel more connected with each other is still yet to be proven

I am someone who has benefited greatly from using the Internet (like sharing this piece of writing) and I have especially gone out of my way to try to use it as intentionally as possible to support the kind of connection, community, and life building initiatives I want.

But sometimes I still wonder the positive impact of the internet outweigh the negatives. 

Over these years I have learned that:
- Our consumption of the internet can become [problematic or addictive](https://bmcpsychiatry.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12888-021-03457-y), can lead more more loneliness.
- Social media use contributed to decline in mental mental, both in a [teens](https://www.sciencenews.org/article/social-media-teens-mental-health) as well as [adults](https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2022/02/right-now-social-media-adult-depression)
- Consuming social media, especially for vulnerable teens between the age of 13 - 17, can contribute to more body dissatisfaction and potentially [trigger more eating disorders](https://www.consumernotice.org/personal-injury/social-media-harm/statistics/). 

During the 24 hour period, I experienced an exponential increase in how deeply connected I am to myself and my inner world. 

It didn't mean make me feel lonely, rather the opposite. It may be so attuned to my own humaness. 

And when I stepped outside to run in the rain

When I saw a few individuals running ahead or along side of me, I felt so connected with them in a way I don't know how to describe. 

Sometimes it does takes us to disconnect from the world, to connect back to ourselves. 

And once we connect to the deeper part of ourselves, that's when we are ready to connect with the world. 

Question to ask yourself:
What would be your intention if you were to do your own 24-hour challenge without internet? And if not, what is a small experiment or challenge you can do to be more connected with yourself?
