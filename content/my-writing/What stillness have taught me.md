I have been meditating every morning consistently for the past 1100+ days. 

When I watched the video of myself meditating today, I was mesmerized by how still I was. There were many moments I felt like I was just looking at a static picture. 

But I wasn't always so comfortable with stillness. Quite the opposite. 

In the past, I was the kid who was known to be rather loud, inpatient, reactive, and sometimes even quick-tempered. 

But through my daily practice of breathing and becoming best friends with my inner world, I have learned 3 big lessons: 

1Ô∏è‚É£ My thoughts and emotions are just like water in a river or clouds in the sky. 

They ebb and flow, wander and meander and the more we control them to fit an expectation or outcome we're attached to, the more we lose control of it. The trick is to observe and eventually accept. 

2Ô∏è‚É£ All the answers, strength, resilience, and feelings of safety lies within us and in this state. 

We often try to find them in others, in material goods, and in the different things we try to acquire. But there is so much comfort in knowing that it is accessible by anyone and at any moment. All it takes is some awareness, trust, and practice.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Like money and muscle, a meditative or mindfulness practice also compounds. 

The difficulty is it can be subtle. You will not be able to one day look at the mirror and see six-packs on your forehead, but you can start to feel the difference. Compounding can feel like becoming more patient, grateful, joyful, loving, attuned to your emotions, and in general more optimistic about life, even in the face of hardships.

A key part of MINDSET is to understand the mind. When you master it, a new life of freedom opens up to you.
