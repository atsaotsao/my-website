Last week I performed spoken word at an talent show for adults. 

And it is one of the proudest things I've done all year. 

Before this, I had never done anything like it in the slightest. 

Sure, I've played and performed musical instruments on the stage before. (the violin & the trumpet to be exact).

And I've given presentations, workshops, pitches, and speeches of all kinds of variety. 

But never have I voluntarily, especially as a adult, be on a stage to pour my heart out in such a poetic fashion. 

When I was walking off into the crowd after my performance, I had a handful of people shook my hand, gave me high-fives, and even hugs, but throughout that whole time I was in an absolute daze. 

I was in a daze because I was honestly lost for words. 

I tried to focus on the energetically invisible things that was happening beneath the surface and in my body and understand it 

And I could feel how that experience poured in me in even ways I cannot understand yet. 

And it made me think of this question: Why do we choose to do or not do the things that get us out of our comfort zone? What's the point of it? 

Here are 2 reasons I believe why it connects to leading a better life:


1. You can re-train the way you speak and interact with your nervous system

When I was waiting for my turn to perform, I could feel a kind of tightness in the middle of my body that I haven't experienced in a long time. 

It was different from the nervousness that I have felt in the past. This one was more visceral and more tight. 

I felt like I could literally feel my NERVES. 

And it did bring me back to all the moments when I was younger where I felt similar sensation. 

And those moments, maybe because the influences of my music teachers or sport coaches, I would often talk to myself in a very displinary, masculine, and stern like way. 

In the past I would have said to myself in a firm and stern manner: "stop being nervous. There's nothing to be nervous about. Just toughen up."

And I would find a way to push that feeling down and deep into my body to deal with whatever that's happening. 

But as an adult, a coach who has better tools and understanding of better tools, I knew that I could take a different approach. 

This time, I gently scanned my body, noticed the textures and shapes of the feelings in my body, and instead of pushing it away, I did these 3 things:

a. I acknowledge it fully with curiosity, love and compassion, and I said to it: "I recognize that you are there and have been around to protect me in the past. Thank you so much, but right now I don't need you and I am inviting you to pass through me and over me."
b. I found the parts of me, especially the inner child in me, that were the sources of feeling that nervousness and I just gently remind him that he is safe, in an environment where he won't be harmed, and that I got his back.
c. I gave myself a small self-hug to remind myself through physical touch that I'm loved, even if my performance and expressions of myself gets rejected 


1. You can learn how to do things for intrinsic and not external rewards

In the past, whenever I was on stage for some kind of performance or showcase, I always did it mainly for some kind of external validation. 

It was always to get praise, validation, applause from an authority figure, form my classmates or colleagues, or just want validation from strangers to make myself feel better.

Because as a kid, I was always craving attention, acceptance, and love. 

But as an adult who has learned to give myself those things, I no longer needed to perform to receive those things. 

Instead, I knew that I could use this opportunity and this arena to redefine what it means to perform. 

I knew that this gave me the perfect opportunity to do something fully to make all parts of myself proud, and that's all that matters.


**What is something you have always wanted to do that is out of your comfort zone?** How can you take one baby step to get started?
