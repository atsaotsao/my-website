In the past few years, I've been writing long heartfelt letters to a few important men in my life. 

The first letter was to my dad. 

I wanted to convey to him everything I have learned about anger, how it had affected me, but more importantly, that despite everything I've experienced growing up, how much love, gratitude, and compassion I have and will always have for him. 

The second was to my best friend from high-school and whom I was the best man for at his wedding early this year. 

I knew he was going through a big transition in his life, and was also dealing with a lot of difficult thoughts and emotions. So in the letter I shared stories about my journey out of depression, told him how meaningful his friendship has meant to me in the past 17 years, and gave suggestions on how he can navigate certain obstacles he's encountering.  

This week I wrote my third letter. 
It was to another close friend here in New York, and I wanted to express some deep hurt and sadness around the state of our friendship— how a series of misunderstanding and miscommunication has contributed to us drifting apart.
