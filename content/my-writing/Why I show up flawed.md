I often have food on my face. 

Whether it's crumbs, spaghetti sauce, cream cheese, or even pieces of rice

And it always invites quite a reaction. 

I've had friends who laughed at me for being so sloppy.
I've had bosses who chewed me out for not being "professional" enough.
I've had partners who felt embarrassed by being with me in public because of it.

The honest truth is that to this day, I still don't know why it happens so often. 

I don't know if it's because I was never fully taught the etiquette of wiping my mouth or that the nerves endings around my mouth is so insensitive that I could never feel it. 

And even typing this this brings up a familiar fear.

The fear reminds me of the feeling of noticing when my blindspots or flaws can cause someone to look at me weirdly. 

To judge me. Misunderstand me. And reject me.

And as a recovering people-pleaser, this always hurt. 

It makes me think about all the different areas of my life where my flaws can bring up the same feelings. 

The way my handwriting is, how illegible it is.
The way I mispronounce words.
The way I write and the occasional grammatical errors that come about. 


There are a list of these flaws that I used to attribute to wanting to hide from the world. 

I was it was so difficult to show up as I am. 

To write, talk, draw, and express because I've had years of memories of voices that tell me that what I'm doing is flawed and therefore not good enough. 

And it took me a while to realize this truth but also my survival tactic:
that showing up flawlessly is overrated. 

The individuals who show up, flawed and all, are individuals who are willing to be human, vulnerable, unpolished, and real in a world where there are more ways to create layers of abstractions and illusions. 

The individuals who show up, flawed and all, are individuals who I can learn to invest my trust and attention in, especially in a world where everyone is gaming for your eyeballs to pitch or sell you something.

Ever since the start of 2024, I've been committing to sharing a video of myself talking to the camera almost every day.

And sometimes it was only after I had already finished recording and editing the videos that I realize that I have a speck of food on my face. 

But I still press the button "post."

Because I will no longer hide my flaws from the world anymore.

And I can trust that whoever judges me or feels cringe because of it, will not like my content or sometimes by extension even me and that's okay.

Because I know there are others who will see me as I am and not just accept it, but want to be around it. 

And that's why I show up flawed.

Because that's the fastest and most powerful way to live a life where you no longer attached to the opinions of others, and can always show up just as you are. 

Come join me.
