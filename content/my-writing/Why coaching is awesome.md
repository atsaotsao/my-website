When I started my entrepreneurial journey back in the second half of 2020, I never imagined being a coach. 

In fact, I didn't even know what a coach does, how they work, and why someone would pay for a service like this. 

I hadn't ever encountered a coach. I never hired a coach before. And I don't know anyone in my life that either is or worked with one.

My limited idea of entrepreneurship during that time was mostly based in tech. I was embracing this new revolution of tools called no-code that allowed any non-technical person, just like me, to create not just websites, but full fledged web and mobile apps without needing to learn how to code.

I was hooked. 

I had this goal of becoming a software founder, where I could build an app that solves a unique problem so well that I can charge $15 - $30 a month for it. Then I will grow it, and then be all set. 

But I struggled. Even though I didn't need to learn how to code, I still struggled with building it. And often times it felt like my idea sucked and wasn't going anywhere. 

Around the same time, someone reached out to me for a call to ask some questions. At that time, I have been experimenting and building with an array of tools for months now and was more than happy to share my knowledge. 

One virtual call eventually evolved to an in-person co-working session, where I offered as much support, knowledge, and help as possible. 

Then she asked me a question that changed the trajectory of my life:
"Will you be my no-code coach?"

That's right. 
She pitched ME to be her coach.

I asked her how much she will be willing to pay for a service like this, that was how I landed my first client and kick-started my coaching career. 

Since that moment, I have worked with 15 coaching clients, and have spent more than 740 hours coaching others how to build and launch their businesses.

Moral of the story? 
Be open the the types of entrepreneurship opportunities that are out there. 
We are often influenced by what we see in social media or in popular culture around what is the "cool" thing or way that makes you the most money quickly. 

The truth is the best types of entrepreneurship, especially when you're starting out, is ones where you can do by yourself, aligns with your strengths and purpose, and bring you a deep sense of joy and satisfaction. 

Being on these coaching calls always make me so energized, empowered, and happy. 

So go forth and be bold. I'll see you next time!
