Sometimes when I reflect back on my entrepreneurship journey, I'm reminded on why it was incredibly hard to start. 

One of the clearest factors was that I just didn't ever have any exposure of it during my life that I knew what it was about. I don't have anyone in my life that does or talks about it.
