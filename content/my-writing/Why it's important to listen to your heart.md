This week I did something big. 

I took a leap and decide to do a pivot that my soul has be aching for me to do for a while now: I am starting a mindset & creativity coaching practice.

I wanted to be someone who can help others overcome their biggest limiting beliefs, so that they can uncover their inner potential, zone-of-genius, creativity, and authenticity, so that they can build and live their best lives.

This was the compounding of a lot of self-work, introspection, mindfulness practice, therapy, reading, writing, building, and sharing I've done in the past 4 years, and I want to share and pass along everything I've learned on this journey.

The moment I decided to walk this path, I felt something shifted inside me. I felt my heart open in a way I can't explain. Everything felt more purposeful and I could tap into my self-belief much more easily. 

But getting to the point to make that leap wasn't easy. It took overcoming some of my own limiting beliefs to get there

These were 3 big limiting beliefs that I had to overcome:

1 - "It's too risky"

This was the first pervasive thought that ran through my mind. 

I can recall a friend stating the statistic fact around the number of entrepreneurs who "make it". Or headlines about the current economy. There were also voices of my parents who believes it's safer to go back to a full-time tech job. 

But when I take a step back, I realize that what usually seems like the riskier path isn't always. In fact, the path we see as safe may often be the one often laden with more uncertainty. 

By trusting in my heart and finding something that aligns deeply with my sense of purpose, while not having to depend on anyone else like a boss, it means I have more control over the success of the venture is therefore the safer bet.

The safest bet is often the one you can bet on yourself. You have the best odds in the house because you know exactly what makes you tick.

2 - "I have to keep doing the thing I'm already the best at"

This was one of the hardest one to overcome. 

I have been working in tech for 9 years, 2 and a half in which I coached founders how to build with no-code.

When I look at my skillsets developed over the years, there was a very rational part of me that thinks that I should stay in this industry and do what I know best. 

"These are skillsets that will be more highly respected in the professional world"

"This is where the money is at! You should stick with it."

"You've already invested so much of your time, energy, and money into this. Why switch now?"

These were all thoughts that were all swirling in my head, begging me to stay put and be "rational".

But I realize that's the scary part about operating in your "zone of excellence." 

Most of us tend to spend most of our time here because it's often something we have spend a lot of years honing our skills around and we not only become extremely skilled at doing it, and even tough we don't love doing it, we enjoy it. 

But it dawned on me the opportunity cost of not operating in my "zone of genius" and I realized that I needed to do it for my future self.


3 - "I want to do it, but I can't afford to go all in"

Or I could just take a half leap. Put my toe in the water but leave room to fall back to my no-code coaching if something didn't work out. Sounds like a great plan right? 

There are [studies](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2538889) that shown that having a Plan B can actually harm us rather than help us.

It also reminded me of a speech Arnold Schwarzeneger once gave called "I Hate Plan B"

"Plan B becomes a safety net," he explains. "It says that if I fail...I have something else there that will protect me, and that's not good. Because people perform better when there is no safety net."
