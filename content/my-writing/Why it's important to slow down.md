Outline: 
- What its important to slow down
- 3 questions help you get started


I used to think the way to achieve your goals is to go at it as intensely and as quickly as possible. 

I believed that winners always sprint to chase after the ball. 

To me, it is the person who perseveres through sweat, tears, and pain that deserves to get the ball and ultimately get the prize, medal or trophy.

But it took me a long time to realize that our mind and legs are not built to be sprinting all the time. 

It is the one who rests intentionally in between, that runs the farthest. 

The greatest and biggest lesson I‚Äôve learned in my late 20s is the paradoxical truth that you need to slow down in order to go faster and farther.

The idea of slowing down and being patient, ‚Äútrusting the universe‚Äù did not come intuitively to me.

And only after doing a lot of work in resetting my nervous system, in nurturing the parts of myself that were ignored all those years, did I understand....Here my two biggest reasons why it's important to slow down: 

1) Burnout is way more common and more complex than you think
When you think about burnout, you probably have an image in your head of what it looks like. 

I picture someone who just returned home from work, looking tired, stressed, and disheveled. 

But the reality is that burnout is way more complex than you think. In fact, there are [12 stages to burnout](https://www.forbes.com/sites/melodywilding/2023/02/21/am-i-burned-out-how-to-recognize-the-12-stages-of-burnout/?sh=3fa18752157b).

Burnout can look different for everyone because we all have different survival capabilities‚Äî someone of us have a high tolerance of stress and could suppress the signals that the nervous system is firing. 

But that doesn't actually mean they can deal with burnout better. It just means there is a higher tendency to push the signals down‚Äî until its too late. 

One of the easiest way to prevent burnout is to have consistent and sustainable ways of slowing down, grounding ourselves, and giving our nervous system a reset and break that it so deserves.


2) Having a marathon mentality
In 2021, the global average life expectancy was just [over 70 years](https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy). 

This is astonishing when you realize that just two hundred years ago, the life expectancy was less than half of that. 

Sometimes its hard to comprehend how long our lives can be. 

We hear often hear people say that "life is short" 

But when you actually slow your pace down, and pay attention the steps you take, the view to enjoy along the way, and the divinity in each passing moment

You will realize that it was never about competing or winning this race

It was always about running it for as far and as long as you can, and doing your best to be in each moment fully, authentically, and with surrender.

Question to ask yourself today:

I personally don't think I fully admitted to myself until I started to write this week's issue that I was already burnt out leading up to being let go from my job in May 2020.

Maybe because I saw myself as having a high tolerance of stress, I never truly realized that I was already emotionally, physically, and mentally exhausted. 

And I especially observed this in other men as well. 



And I started to observe the same thing in others as well. 

I would see 

A friend of mine once described this imagery of a candle where its burning from two sides. 

That captured 



As a young kid living in the hustle and bustle of New York City The moment I landed in this concrete jungle back on July 5th, 2013, I already felt like there were a lot of things I needed to prove to myself, my peers, and my family. 

Having just come out of a bout of depression, I felt like I had so much catching up to do and I needed to start picking up my pace as soon as possible to not fall behind of everyone I know who already had their life planned. 

And that energy was so potent and powerful that it pushed me to have the courage to try a lot of things I didn't see folks in my age were doing and it led me to: 

- Be a bartender
- Be a door-to-door salesman selling office supplies
- Be a sales associate selling high-end jewelry safe
- Be a sales manager at a software startup
- Be a product manager at a software startup


It pushed me to have this extra oomph of energy and motivation to push me to meet my goals. And I could always channel it whenever I want, and it led to me pivot through multiple job roles and eventually I found a company where I could give my all. 

But when I lost that job in May 2020, it felt like the world suddenly became dark and I felt my entire being collapsed. 

And then it felt like a perfect storm of issues. 
I remember noticing that there was a persisting chronic pain in my upper back that just wouldn't go away. 

I was experience bouts of anger that I never experienced before. 

And only after doing a lot of work in resetting my nervous system, in nurturing the parts of myself that were ignored all those years, did I understand the 3 biggest reasons why it's important to slow down:
