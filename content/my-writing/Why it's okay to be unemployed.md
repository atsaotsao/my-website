When I got let go from my job back in May 2020, my dreams were shattered. 

I hated how crappy it made me feel.

Hated how lost I was.
Hated how worthless I felt.
Hated how I have to start over.

Basing my self-worth and confidence on the salary and status of the job title was no longer an option. 

I was raised to always keep looking for the next job. Staying unemployed always felt like it was the irresponsible thing to do and that I was going to be left behind.

I was also afraid of being judged. Being labeled as lazy.

But because of the forced isolation and silence of the pandemic, I paused. And in pausing I started to think, to listen to my inner thoughts, to ask questions, and slowly I started exploring new frontiers of my mind and of my potential.

I spent hours upon hours educating myself about no-code and started building and launching all kinds of experiments, which led me to making my first internet dollars.

I picked up reading again, started meditating, and begun to open my heart and mind up to all my thoughts and emotions. It even led me to writing a 14 page letter to my dad about anger.

I started coaching others on building and launching digital products and businesses. My first coaching client even wrote me a handwritten thank you letter that I still keep pinned next to my desk.

Ever since I've graduated, I've avoided unemployment like a plague, but I would have never imagined that unemployment could be one of my biggest teachers.

These are the 3 big lessons I've learned from unemployment: 

1* The difference between being vs. doing
One of the biggest traps of living in the post-industrial or capitalistic society is that the world rewards doing. 

The better you are at doing your job, providing value, or making money, the more rewarded or respected you are. 
   
I learned that I have spent the majority of my life doing rather than being. 

Because of what my parents, school, and later my jobs demanded of me, I prided myself as a doer. But when I stopped, it felt like I didn't know how to live.

That was the push for me to learn to be. Through practicing mindfulness, I slowly learned to just be. 

And in being, I learned that I am enough and deserved to be loved just the way I am, not because of the things I do.
   

2*  The importance of slowing down

I learned that you need to slow down in order to go faster and farther. It's a paradoxical truth that bears repeating.

I've spent so many late nights, travels, and even weekends bent over my laptop with bad posture working, all because I wanted to do well. 

And in doing well, I could be seen as valuable to the team and company. And that means that the velocity of my trajectory of rising to be a VP or even a Chief of Product one day can be faster. 

But when I lost the job, not only was that plan completely derailed, but I realized that I had not been taking care of my mind and body. 

I had put on a lot weight and I started noticing a chronic back pain that wouldn't go away. 

And where there was no longer work to occupy my mind, I noticed how it was 
always anxious, impatient, and restless. 

It made me realize that life is marathon, and if want to run farther, I have to prioritize self-care, practice doing things more slowly and intentionally, and utilize all the tools I can get my hands on to avoid burnout.

Since then, I have learned to be less attached to outcomes and to have stronger mental fitness when it comes to dealing with the uncertainties in life.

3* Hearing life's whispers

After I stopped doing, started being, and learned to slow down, I started to realize just how much space and time I had. 

At first, I was bored out of my mind. I had so much time on my hand that I didn't even know what to do with it.

But slowly I realize it's also the first time I am the most attuned to my thoughts and emotions. 

I used the opportunity to journal and reflect on my thoughts, goals, and aspirations. Things I wanted for me, not because it's defined by a "should" from someone else.

And in doing that, it was the first time I understood what Oprah meant when she often says that "Your life speaks to you in whispers." 

For the first time I can hear the whispers and I knew that I needed to be an entrepreneur and I never looked back.


If you are someone who has recently lose his/her job or have been unemployed for a while, 

### Come to my senses:
_(sight, smell, touch, sound, taste)_

- This "show" [In & Of Itself](https://www.hulu.com/movie/19b9d405-40b2-483e-8e1f-e25fe10c7299) on Hulu is the best thing I've seen in a long long time. If you are feeling disconnected with the world and with humanity, don't sleep on this!
- Go down the rabbit hole with me on this [reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/rbh2ev/whats_the_worst_smell_youve_ever_smelled/) answering the question: "what's the worst smell you've ever smell?"
- This year I'm committed to improving my handwriting. For some reason, my brain took me to researching about [Da Vinci's notebook](https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/leonardo-da-vincis-notebooks) ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- I love listening to these raw and vulnerable [voice-mails](https://www.postsecretvoicemail.com/) from random anonymous strangers on the internet
- I've been drinking matcha instead of coffee since last year because it gives me a ["cleaner" caffeine high](https://www.theteamakers.co.uk/blogs/news/matcha-vs-coffee). Give it a try!




To be continued...

üçÉ I started coaching 




 I moved to a permaculture farm and got my hands dirty for 3 months n, I bought a ticket to Thailand and taught English for 2 years 
  Started freelance writing & editing and traveled around for another 2 I'd finally met genuinely happy people. Not because they didn't exist in Boston where I'd been living. But because I was finally attracting people that reflected the true me. One of them ended up becoming my wife. The lesson? 
  
  It's cliche as hell but follow your gut. I knew I was living an empty life, but I had no idea how to fill it with meaning. Sometimes, you need to burn it all down and start again. You'll find the answer when you let go of preconceived notions and lean into the shit that scares you. The answer is usually on the other side of that discomfort.
