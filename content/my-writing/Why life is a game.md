Life is a game that one plays according to the rules.

This is a quote from the book catcher in the rye. 

But most of us get lost in these rules. And in the process we forget even what games we're playing and what it meant to play or win at this game.

Let me explain.

The moment we started school, we were all taught a very specific set of rules. 

These rules were based around merit: grades, papers, presentations, tests, and eventually degrees. 

Then the rules become a little more complex: the rules of adulthood requires certain jobs, salaries, promotions, and stability. 

And soon, the rules starts to evolve.

It started to include a partner, kids, a home, vacations, pension fund, and soon we find ourselves teaching our own kids the same rules.

The promised perks and rewards of following these rules is that after age 65, you get to reap the rewards and "win" by doing whatever it is you want.

And only then, are you finally able to enjoy happiness, fulfillment, peace, and freedom that you've been working so hard for.

The most unfair thing about this set of rules is the list of conditions it requires for us win this game.

We shouldn't have to wait until 65 or older to feel like we have finally won.

And one of the biggest lies that a capitalistic system and world taught us is that we were meant to play this game alone.

And that by winning, it required us to beat, step-on, or even exploit other players.


The moment I realized all of this, is the moment I realize I didn't want to play the same game anymore. 

I want to create my own game with my own rules, where winning meant that I also get to do whatever it is I want starting now. 

And that I also can enjoy happiness, fulfillment, peace, and freedom, but starting now.

And that even though it is a single-player game, that I didn't have to do it alone. 

That there are other players, allies, and communities that I can lean on, learn from, and play together. 

And that there is enough resources for us to share, and there is a way where we can all collectively win together.

And the first step is to radically imagine that this world is possible and that is one we deserve.

The next step is define your path and your role in building it. 

Would you like to join me?
