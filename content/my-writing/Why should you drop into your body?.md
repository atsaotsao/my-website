### Outline: 
- When I mention "let's drop into your body" during my coaching 
- How our thoughts creates feelings (how the brain works 101)
- Why it's important 


This is one of my most common and favorite thing to say to a client during a coaching session:

"Let's drop into the body. How does it feel?"

Recently, somebody responded with a simple question: "Why should I drop into my body? What's the point?"

I realized that I wanted to have a more holistic and cohesive answer to this question, so I've decided to answer it in this week's issue.


### Brain Chemistry 101

To start it's helpful to have a little foundational knowledge of how our brains works. 

To start here is a generally how a cell in our body looks like


Look great right? 7th grade me studying biology would be proud. 

One of the cool things about these cells is that they have receptors all over, and they're there to be ready to connect to, interact with, or be influenced by *ligands*. 

Ligands are simply the things that binds with the cells to form a complex and produce some effect. 

And to understand our brain, its helpful to understand three key types of ligands: *neurotransmitter*, *neuropeptides*, and *hormones*.

Neurotransmitters are basically chemical messengers whose main job is to send signals between nerve cells, allowing the brain and nervous system to communicate. 

They are small, fast-acting chemicals that transmit signals between your neurons or to a target cell and the two most commonly known ones are dopamine and serotonin.

Neuropeptides are a sub-type of neurotranmitters and actually make up the majority of these messengers but behave differently. Their main job is to act as a signaler for releaseing chemical message to the body with specific instructions.

Unlike neurotranmitters, they are bigger and slower, but not only do they tend to have a broader range of signals they deliver, they can even modulate the activity of neurotransmitters.

When these neuropeptides make their way into our body and bloodstream, they will usually attach themselves to the cells of various tissues (primarily glands) 

Here is picture of the glands

And this is when our bodies turn on the third type of ligand which is hormones. Our homeones is what further influence to feel certain ways. 

Here's the breakdown of what we learned so far:

- Neurotranmissiters are chemical messengers primarily from the brain and mind
- Neuropeptides are chemical signalers that serve as a bridge between the brain and the body to make us feel the way we think
- Hormones are the chemical related to feelings primarily in the body

### How Mind & Body Are Connected

Now that we got a the basic sciences out of the way, it's time to connect it to the part that I feel most excited about talking about which is how all of this explains just intricately our mind & body are connected. 

To illustrate that let's walk through a real life example of something I recently experienced that many of can relate which is an unresolved argument I have with my partner. 

When I was sitting in front of my desk getting rady to work, I suddenly remember some of the details of our fight. 

In this moment, my brain whips up some neurotransmitters that turns on a network of neurons, which creates pictures and thoughts in my head. 

In this case, I probably thought about the specific image of the household task or errand that instigated the argument. 

This prompts a chain reaction where it stimulate the release of specific neuropeptides into my bloodstream. 

Once they reached my adrenal gland (the gland most responsible in our physiological response to anger), those peptides bind to the cells on those tissues.

Then they turn on my hormonal system, and very quicky, I begin to *feel* exactly the way I was just *thinking*. And this case, I probably became angry. 

My body will send a very clear message back to my brain saying, "Yup, I'm feeling really ticked off right now." 

My brain, which is constantly communicating with the body and monitoring its internal chemical order, immediately notice the change in the way I'm feeling.

And as a result, I begin to think differently. 

In this moment, I begin to *feel* the way I *think* AND *think* the way I feel. 

I unconsciously reinforce the same feeling I was feeling by thinking the similar angry and frustrated thoughts, which makes me more angry and frustrated. 

Without realizing, my feelings are now controlling my thinking. 

My body is now driving my mind. 

And in the past, it wouldn't even end here. I would continue to allow the cycle to continue. 

Angry thoughts -> produce more chemical signals to body -> activate adrenal chemicals asosciated with angry feelings -> angry thoughts 


The cycle of anger can turn frustration into rage. 

I would feel flushed, my stomach will feel twisted into a knot, my head pounds, and my muslce may start to clench. 

And all these physiological changes will cause me to think equal to those emotions. 

I will start think of all these things I want to say to my partner. 

I will even conjure up a list of past events and evidences that validate my present upsetness.

And I would even brainstorm the ways I would have her understand the extent of my anger and have her resolve it.

And all of this started with a single thought.

### Change is Hard

This is why sometimes it can feel so goddamn hard to change. 

The loops of chemical reactions that I described above have probably happened thousands of times in my life without me realizing it. 

They have trained my body to memorize that emotional state to a point where whenever a similar stimulus is introduced, my body can almost be on autopilot and run an subconscious automatic program to respond to it. 

This is also why early in my journey, I always felt like [Sisyphus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisyphus) pushing the boulder up a mountain. 

And even though I would practice a lot of mindset shifts and positive thinking like "I want to be less angry, more happy, and feel free" 

It always felt like my body couldn't catch up. 

My intellectual mind may say that it wants joy, but the body has been programmed to feel otherwise for years. 

And if we remember early on explanation about neurotransmitters vs. neuropeptides, neuropeptides have actually the ability to modulate a neutrotransmitters activity

Which is why 

And it always make me think of this quote from the book *Breaking the Habit of Being Yourself*: **"When the mind and body are in opposition, change will never happen"**

### So why drop into the body? 

The main goal of doing something as simple as putting our attention on our bodies is to strengthen our mind-body connection. 

Very quickly you will start to *feel* how emotiosn are never just mental experiences, but something we feel so viscerally and physically. 

And by paying attention to our bodily sensations, we become more acutely aware of our emotional state.

At the same time, focusing on the body can help anchor us in the present moment, instead of the thoughts and stories we create in our head. 

One of the main goals of practicing this is to have a more integrated undestanding of your state of being.

A state of being means you have become familar with a your menta-
