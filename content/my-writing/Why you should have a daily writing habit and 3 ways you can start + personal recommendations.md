5 outline:
- What writing has done for me
- My writing journey since 2020 (how it started)
- 3 ways to get started 


Writing online consistently has helped me become the person I am today.

The first time I wrote online and press "publish" was in January 7th, 2020 on a tool that no longer exists called [200 Words A Day](https://www.producthunt.com/products/200-words-a-day#200-words-a-day). 

I had a new year resolution of wanting to write more, but at the time, the idea of writing daily in a notion or google doc just felt very lonely. On the other hand, I had absolutely no confidence starting and publishing in a blog. But in this tiny corner of the internet, I decided that it was easy to just focus on showing up daily to write 200 words or more and see how long I can keep up the streak.

And I did exactly that for 273 consecutive days. Most days I had absolutely no idea what I was going to write about, and I would often wait until 11:30 pm to write just so that I wouldn‚Äôt break my streak. 

Through writing daily I gain the confidence to: 
- create my first monthly [newsletter on music](https://25on25.com/) (which I have published 41 issues so far)
- Showed up daily on [Twitter/X](https://twitter.com/atsaotsao) to write short-form content
- Wrote my first-ever [guest blog post](https://www.make.com/en/use-cases/notion-webflow) for a no-code tool that I love and use everyday
- Started my coaching business
- Became a startup mentor where I run workshops to teach students from the National University of Singapore about building products
- Started my [new newsletter](https://atsaotsao.beehiiv.com/) that you're reading now 

In additional to the tangible wins, what was surprising to me is seeing the internal transformation that was happening. I've started noticing just how much more confident I was with expressing myself. I started to gain more clarity of my thoughts and emotions, creativity in problem solving, and finally, the ability to think more critically and synthesize experiences and knowledge that I gain each day. Most importantly, writing daily have given me the optimism to tackle a world in all its unpredictability, and I'm incredibly grateful for it.

If my writing journey story resonated with you, and you want to start writing consistently, here are 3 ways you can get started:

1) State your intentions out loud and just start
Starting is always the hardest and the easiest. 

There are a million reasons you can read online about why you should pick up a writing habit, but only you would know and can decide why its important to you and you only.

Write down the why, then speak it out loud to yourself. If you want you can even use this as your first prompt to expand on. 

Questions you can ask yourself during this process:
- What are the baby or atomic steps you can take each day to fulfill your intentions?
- What are the emotions that comes up for you during this process?
- What are some limiting beliefs or discomfort that you still have?

2) Find a writing community 
Online writing communities are the open secret to developing a daily writing habit. 

I would not have been able to sustain a writing habit if it wasn't for an online community that made me feel safe enough to show up every day.

‚ú® Personal Favorite:
[Lifelog](https://golifelog.com/)- built by [Jason Leow](https://twitter.com/jasonleowsg), a friend and fellow 200Wordsaday Alumni, this is where I still pay and write daily on. It's for anyone who wants to start and continue developing a writing habit.

üö¢ Popular in my network: 
[Ship30for30](https://www.ship30for30.com/meet-our-alumni)- a cohort-based writing course that encourages you to write 30 essays for 30 consecutive days out in public.

üòé Most Underated:
IRL writing communities- sometimes nothing beats the real-life camaraderie you get of being the same room as someone who just gets it. I recommend starting by looking at your local library or even museums to see if they are hosting free creative writing workshops for anyone to attend.

3) Make it fun and fresh for yourself
I‚Äôve learned that whenever I find a way to make something fun for myself, it‚Äôs a lot easier for me to develop the intrinsic motivation to show up each day to do something.  
  
Even in writing, there‚Äôs ways you can make it bit more entertaining and fun for yourself, especially in the beginning.

‚ú® Personal Favorite:
[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)- this is where I start and end my day (literally). It gives me a lot of comfort knowing that this free tools allows me to write even when I'm offline, allows me to connect my writing if needed, and is stored in a format that is easily accessible (the founder wrote it best).

üí£ If You Like to Write Dangerously:
[Squibler](https://www.squibler.io/dangerous-writing-prompt-app)- This tool encourages you to keep writing for an amount of time set by you. The crux is this: if you stop writing for too long, everything will be erased and you'll be forced to start again, so tread lightly!

üé∂ If You're Feeling Jazzy:
[JazzKeys](https://jazzkeys.plan8.co/)- Have you ever had a dream where you can compose jazz while writing a blog post? While dream no further, this tool helps you do exactly that. It even allows you to share you writing/composition. Here's mine.
