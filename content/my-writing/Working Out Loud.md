 My favorite thing about having a bookshelf filled with books I haven’t read yet (mostly books of my girlfriend’s brother + a handful that I’ve picked up from the streets of Brooklyn) is when I get to pick a new one after finishing a recent book. Sure, the paradox of choice does kicks in, but I often try to let the book pick me rather than the other way around.

This time I was looking at my bookshelf to look for if there are any books I can throw away and I noticed a book called _Working Out Loud_ by John Stepper, that had a grey dull book cover and its an old copy of a book that was published in 2015. Since I was throwing it away, I decided to take a glance at it but what I was not expected was how it drew me in. The idea of “working out loud” also echoes a lot of new things I’m learning about “building-in-public.”

John Stepper summarized “working out loud as”

> …an approach to work and life. It helps you achieve your goals and feel better about work while you discover more possibilities  
> Think “Dale Carnegie meets the Internet.” AS you work out loud, you leverage principles for building meaningful relationships as well as ways to share your work, get feedback, and interact with others who share your nterests. Importantly, you wrap all of this in a mindset of generosity. All that’s required is a set of skills and habits that anyone can learn.

The book may be slightly dated, but it had a lot of nuggets that I intend to summarize and eventually share with the Twitter “build-in-public” crowd.
