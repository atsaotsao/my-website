My idea of a typical journey of personal development goes like this:

1. Stimuli that inspires an individual to be motivated to change
2. Exploration of systems, tools, and advices
3. Implement these system and repeat
4. Fail, and find new systems or make adjustments to it
5. Repeat until you hit a turning point
6. Combine numerous things you learn to create your own system
7. Implement your own system, and start seeing growth and results
8. As you start to get more things piled on, become overwhelmed with system
9. Make systematic or mental adjustments
10. Fine-tune into a system that forgives

A system that forgives isn't particular a feature design, but rather describe a stage or relationship to your system that I feel like I've finally arrived. It means that I have systems to make sure my tasks are tracked, my habits, my writing, my websites, my countless reviews, but at the end of the day, when I'm overwhelmed, I no longer feel guilty, shame, or even discouragement for not keeping up with the system. And these systems are designed where as long there is a little maintenance, you can get back on track over a weekend.

I'm grateful for creating a system for myself that forgives, because in this space of forgiveness, I have even more confidence in it supporting me through the long-term.
