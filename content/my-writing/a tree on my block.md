There is a tree on my block
that I always look at whenever I go get groceries.
It stands so much taller than the trees around it
and makes me wonder what it has seen. 

I imagine its humble beginnings
When it was still just a tiny shrub 
that could almost break at any moment
yet it stands here today, towering and magnificent.

I took my partner to look at it today
She said, I never realize that it was there
Maybe because I never really looked up.
And maybe most people don't look up.

But I do, and I like to imagine myself as that tree
Even though people can walk by me 
And not understand all I've seen and been through
I will still be there, for anyone to lean on.
