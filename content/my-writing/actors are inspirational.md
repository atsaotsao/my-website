 I often draw a lot of inspiration from actors. When I'm watching a movie or TV show, sometimes I zoom out and think about the journey and hard work it took for the actor to even get the opportunity to act in the scene unfolding in front on me. I think about how many auditions they've been to just to get a small part and having multiple of them compound before making it to part that's big enough. I think about about how optimistic they have to be to start on the journey, and to continue through knowing that there are so many obstacles along the way. I think about how many people give up along the way and how many naysayers one will meet to detract them from that perceived far-fetched goal. I think a lot of about how it relates to all large aspirations that seems so unattainable. 

When I lose hope in my own journey, I always envision the individuals that made it all the way through and I imagine a world where I can stand next to them, and celebrate our small and big wins together. 

I don't aspire to be an actor who is a superstar, but I do aspire to channel their unrelenting spirit when things get tough.
