I'm sitting on a 5:30 pm flight from JFK to LAX. 

It's the one of the first times in a while that I have the windows seat as I usually reserve it for my partner (now fiance). 

I looked out at my window and looking down at all the city lights, I can't help but feel a sense of wonder. It feels so significant yet so insiginificant at the same time. 

It makes me think about the "overview effect" where an astronaut looks at the earth from afar and what he/she realizes when seeing the world they're so familiar with in a completely new angle. It changes them. 

For me looking out the window, maybe it's because of the affirmations that I have just bene listening to, but I also realize how insignificant I am. I am accepting both how small and big I am. How powerful yet powerless. Unique and special but also one sand in a sea of consciousness. 

It's why the marriage of the eastern and western philosophy of self vs collective is both so important. There is truth in both of them, but the real difficulty is truly understanding how to have a healthy relationship with both. 

Lean too much into the collective, and you lose your sense of self. You will pick jobs, talk, dress, act, and just be in a way where you feel like is expected or needed to fit in or create harmony in the environment you live in while ignoring the self and the complex experiences and emotions that comes along with it. 

Lean too much into the self, your sense of self become inflated. Whether its ego, pride, or vanity, you become so focused on your own needs that you see the world revolve around you. You become selfish, and you tailor a life that will help you continue gain wealth, power, and influence just because you can continue enhancing that image of self. 

I feel like I have spent the majority of my life tailoring more the collective, and even though there has been some flip-flopping or sea-sawing between the two over the years, I feel like I'm ready to embrace the new year with just a little more selfishness. 

I want to protect my peace. I want to be intentional about every single connection I make. And I want to learn to less codependent and less attached to the opinions, affection, and attention from others.
