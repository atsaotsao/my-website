Today, I'd like to discuss the significance of listening to albums in their entirety. This approach allows us to appreciate the artist's intentions and view their work as a whole. While many people use music as background noise or mood setters, it is an accessible form of beauty and artwork that deserves our full attention.

Growing up and being surrounded by music as my mom is a piano teacher, I've always been grateful for its presence in my life. And with streaming services offering access to any song at our fingertips, I always felt that I was so   privileged compared to previous generations who relied on physical records.

However, I'm disappointed with how modern consumption habits have shifted away from appreciating complete albums. Early iTunes and Apple Music days contributed by valuing individual songs at 99 cents, which needs to be further split up to pay for songwriting, production, and record labels' share. Streaming services like Spotify continue this trend through playlist-based consumption, where the focus is on single and not on the albums.

Initially, I too relied heavily on playlists such as Discover Weekly or curated ones. However, after immersing myself into more music, I realized the importance of experiencing entire albums â€“ allowing me to understand the full story behind an artist's work rather than just a snapshot. Kendrick Lamar's To Pimp a Butterfly serves as a prime example; it was this album that made me appreciate hip-hop for the first time, and blew my mind way open when it come to how an album can sound. 

So if you're still reading this, next time you're listening to music on Spotify, try listening to an album from beginning to end. You wont regret it.
