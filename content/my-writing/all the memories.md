What is the earliest memory you have? Whenâ€™s the last time you had French toast? When did you last sat on a Ferris wheel? What about a sled? What about the last big fight you had with your sibling? What was the weather like when you had your first kiss?

I often play these memory jogging games with myself; maybe thatâ€™s why people around me often ask me how I remember certain memories in such vivid details. When it comes to memory, our minds have a hard drive as well as an archive. When information gets stored, it first gets saved in our person hard drives. Only during our sleep, do our minds make a decision to move the most relevant and important memories to our long term archives; picture as the most advanced kind of machine learning sorting through all data of all we obtain in our day to day lives.

What if a day comes when thereâ€™s technology that would actually save the entire essence of an memory? Rather just a high quality video of our 7 year old son blowing the candles from his ice cream cake, we are able to store what that day smell and sound like, how exactly happy he was when he opened his gift to receive his first transformer. Would having technology that automatically remembers for us, would we be happier?
