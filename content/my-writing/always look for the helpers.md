Every time I'm feeling overwhelmed from all the chaos around me, especially from perceiving the world through the lenses of the conversations, news, and real-life reactions revolving around fear and panic all around me, I think back to one of Mr. Roger's quote ([Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LGHtc_D328)):

> Always look for the helpers. There will always be helpers

It's easy to focus on all the negative things because news that incites fear and anger spread the fastest. Over the past few days, I can always count on my Facebook messenger friend groups, or Slack chat groups, or a phone call from my relatives to update me on either the number of active cases in New York or the absurdity of people who still aren't taking it seriously likeÂ [this](https://twitter.com/jake_bittle/status/1238585779166863360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1238585779166863360&ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fny.eater.com%2F2020%2F3%2F14%2F21179790%2Fcoronavirus-nyc-restaurants-alexandria-ocasio-cortez)Â photo of a bar in my neighborhood taken on Tuesday.

The truth is, if you look into the right places, uncover the heavy rocks of news being heavily circulated, you might find pockets of people all trying to chip in and help. I see slack groups setup by remote volunteers to work together to tackle problems they can help solve. I see tools being built, from full-fledge visualizations to NoCode prototypes all done with the goal of helping the community.

When I look at these helpers, all I can do is smile, because I'm so hopeful despite what's to come.
