One of my primary concerns regarding AI is its potential impact on humanity's quest for self-actualization and happiness. I firmly believe in our individual responsibility to be the best, most authentic versions of ourselvesâ€” transcending socioeconomic backgrounds, past experiences or traumas, and physical limitations, and finding out own ways to be our most authentic and self-actualized selves. This can be achieved through spirituality, personal development, education, and creative pursuits.

However, I fear that excessive reliance on AI may further complicate the already challenging journey toward authenticity. True self-discovery demands a whole lot of introspection and gently and patiently tapping into our inner worlds to understand who we are when separated from external influences such as opinions of parents and peers, societal expectations, the news and so many factors that shape our beliefs. Authenticity means zooming out from these distractions to access a heart-centered perspective on our true selves.

AI tools like ChatGPT might inadvertently encourage reliance on external forces consolidated by crowdsourced data. But at the end of the day, I am beginning to hold on to the optimism that allowed me to take me this far. Its tools like Audiopen, which also helped me organize my thoughts for this post, can spark curiosity about how technology can be used intentionally to support rather than hinder our ultimate goals of just understanding ourselves better and also through better self-expression.
