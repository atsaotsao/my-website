 A bad day is when you wake up and you already feel heavy. 
A bad day is when you noticed the gloomy weather mirrors what's inside your head.
A bad day is when you realize how much work it takes to curve up your lips for a smile.
A bad day is when even music can't cheer you up.
A bad day is when everything seems pointless. 
A bad day makes you cry.
A bad day makes you want to sleep early.
A bad day never seems to resolve itself.
A bad day beats out two good days.
A bad day. A bad day.
There's nothing much else to say.
I might be having a bad day, but that's okay.
After all, it's only just one day.
