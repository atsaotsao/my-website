 This week I started reading a book called *Psychology of Money* and I joked with a close friend of mine that he was the reason I picked up the book. In getting to know him, he was the first person I really got to see how his relationship with money is so deeply related to the environment he grew up in, the environment his dad was in, and most importantly the resulting traumas that affected him to see money as the number one important thing to gain in life. 

One of the things that immediately stood out to me in this book was about having a "barbelled personality" when it comes to approaching one's future especially in the context of finance and wealth. It's the duality of being optimistic about the future, but paranoid about what will prevent you from getting to the future. This deeply resonated with me as I'm still learning to build wealth on my own terms and starting a coaching practice, I am learning to deal with being patient with my day-to-day progress while also knowing when to use mechanisms to give myself a higher sense of urgency so I don't feel like I'm feeling content or lazy. 

The honest truth is that I still don't really understand deeply about the game that is capitalism as my mind tends to focus on positive-sum games which I still deeply believe is possible, but in order to prosper, I also need to be fluent in the zero-sum games that people are playing even if I don't want to dedicate my life toward it.
