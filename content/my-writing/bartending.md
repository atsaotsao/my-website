On my first day on my bartending job, my shaker exploded and I spilled Mai Tai on a customer. 

It was the first time I ever used a "boston shaker" and my only previous experience was making cocktails with the IKEA cocktail set for my friends in my dorm room. 

And the truth is that I landed the job at this modern chinese cuisine resteraunt because of slight miscommunication during the referral process. 

But here I was, standing in front of a customer covered in a concotions of pineapple juice, orange juice, spiced and coconut rum. 

How am I going to keep my job after this?

But here's the wildest lesson I have learned and continued to learned ever since. 

Which was offering your presence to someone can be the greatest gift. 

I had already spent 30 minutes chatting with him prior to the incident about his day, even the movie he was going to go across the street to watch after his meal. 

And I knew that was the reason when my boss came to check in on the customer, he didn't complain and he contiunue to sit and chat especially after I offered him an additional glass of wine on the house.

On my very first day as a bartender, I spilled a Mai Tai all over a customer.

The shaker exploded in my hands. Pineapple juice, orange juice, coconut rum, spiced rum—everywhere.  It's the the kind of mess you don’t forget.  

I remember freezing and thinking:  
“How in the world am going to keep my job after this?”

Especially because I wasn’t exactly “qualified” for the role.

The truth is, I landed that bartending gig at this modern Chinese restaurant  because of a slight miscommunication during the referral process.  
My only cocktail experience up until then was making drinks in my dorm room with an IKEA bar set.

But what happened next surprised me.

The customer didn’t complain.  
He actually smiled, laughed, and kept chatting with me.
Only looking back did I think it was because I’d already spent 30 minutes genuinely talking to him about his day, his weekend plans, even the movie he was headed to after dinner.

And that’s when I learned a lesson I still carry years later:
→ Your presence can be more powerful than your performance.

It’s easy to obsess over getting the technique right.  
But people remember how you make them feel.

That day, my cocktail skills flopped.  
But my ability to connect? That’s what saved me.

And in many ways, it still does.
I try to remind myself this very thing whenever I'm coaching someone. 

Have you ever messed up spectacularly only to realize it wasn’t the mistake that defined the moment? 











In case you're not aware of what goes in that drink, it contains pineapple, orange juice, with spiced and coconut flavored rum.
