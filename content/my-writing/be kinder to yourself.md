 Whoever is reading this, I want to remind you to be kind and love yourself! 

Today, I was catching up with a friend we got to talking about a lot of the anxieties she has at this time of the year and how even the omicron variant exacerbate a lot of the emotions that were already swirling around in her head, but after a long conversation I realized the way she talked about herself was filled with a lot of criticism and shame. Even though I've know her since 5th grade, something about this exchange made me see her clearly for the first time and I just asked her a simple question, "Do you love yourself?"

The more I dig, the more I realize the way she talked to herself isn't someone who truly loves every part of one self. That partly has to do with her religious background being very conservatively christian, and how she define's herself as a "sinner" who because of her imperfection does not deserve love. 

It's cheesy to say this, but before you can love other you have to love yourself first! Treat yourself. Take yourself on a date. That's one person you just have to be with for the rest of your life.
