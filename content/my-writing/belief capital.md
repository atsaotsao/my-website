 I love motivating others. I love this idea of a “belief capital” where you’re investing in others by encouraging them, highlighting their strengths and value, help them uncover the barriers that prevent them from achieving what they want, and even offer different ways to support through consistent encouragement or through the active role of being a continuous accountability partner. The best thing about this idea is that it doesn’t cost a single penny, yet it yields so much, at least in the long term.

I’ve noticed I have so many people who are close to me who have a high affinity with language; they care about it, they like it, and they’re good at it. I found myself in this interesting position where I, the worst writer of the group by far, am motivating them to write more. I feel so honored, to be able to use my experience with consistency, to teach them the importance of doing something daily. One of them asked me today, while we were strolling in the park, sometimes what has prevented her to send out a newsletter is thinking the thoughts, “What’s the point?” After a few more back and forth questions I was able to uncover something that I found beautiful. The point I said is exactly what you said: “Which is write about beauty in the unexpected mundaneness of our daily lives.”

Time after time again, I’m still baffled by how uncommon it is for people to write more consistently. If those who are good with words don’t find the need and motivation to write more, why would someone who doesn’t consider themselves a good writer or writing something worth working on? I’m curious to see if I can get someone who doesn’t particularly like language but slowly discover the value of writing in improving self-expression. We’ll see.
