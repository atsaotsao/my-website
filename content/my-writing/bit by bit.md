 Everything I have accomplished has been done bit by bit.
 
Piece by piece, I tackle the pieces of the puzzle.
Breath by breath, I pump myself past another obstacle.
Step by step, I carry myself over the goal line, and onto a new one.

This isn't a hamster wheel, nor an ever-ending staircase,
And it's definitely not a puzzle that can't be solved.

But the answer, one that I always know but still can't always see clearly,
is knowing that it lies in the present, the process, and not the end in sight.

So you can count on me to be back here, there, everywhere

Back at it again
Bit by bit
Piece by pice
Breath by breath
Step by step.
