We all learned in 2006 one way or another that Pluto, the blue marbled spherical mass positioned 9th in our past documentations of our solar system, was not a planet. This meant that in the 21st century we only have 8 planets in our solar systems, yet at American Airlines there are a total of 9 boarding groups.

I remembered how much frustration I felt when I first saw "Boarding Group 9" on my ticket as I was waiting to fly home from Cinncinati OH back to New York City. I've always felt uncomfortable about the experience of flying, there are constant reminders of social orders, tiers, and hierarchies. For getting through security, there is now a general boarding, a TSA Pre-Check, a Global Entry, and Clear, all with different lengths of the queue and each has a price you can pay to increase convenience. When you finally get to your gate on time, then you wait for the calling of your boarding group; in American Airlines' case, I have to wait for the numbers 1 through 8 to be called out before I make my way to stand in line again. Finally, when I finally boarded the plane, I then have to pass through the First and Business Class passengers who were already boarded, then make my way to the back section of the plane where I can finally scoot my way to the window seat; happy with myself that I got the best seat out of the 3 options I had.

It's inevitable that the majority of products and businesses today are the same way. They would create these tiers and premium memberships to offer more features, benefits, and convenience. Heck, half of the worlds' SaaS businesses today are priced this way. Those that aren't, which often offer the products for free, tend to find ways to make money instead of taking advantage of users' data. I often wonder if there's a better way of doing things; a better way to build technology that drives users to pay for it without feeling that a need to gamify their loyalty and engagement and to create an experience where every user always feels like the Sun rather than Pluto; to be first in line, in Boarding Group 1, and sitting in First Class.
