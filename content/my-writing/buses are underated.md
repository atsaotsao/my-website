When it comes to technological innovations in transportation, people's mind immediately go to the flashier things: self-driving cars, electronic vehicles, and hyperloop. We think about the beautifully designed Tesla cars, from Model 3 to the most recently revealedÂ [Cybertruck](https://www.tesla.com/cybertruck), but rarely do we think about how we can better improve our public transportation. Recently, I listened to a transit expert,Â [Stephen Higashide](https://nacto.org/person/steven-higashide/)Â talk about the power of buses to remake our cities for the better in an episode of a podcast calledÂ [99 percent invisible](https://99percentinvisible.org/).

Americans today take 4.7 billion trips on a bus a year, but most of these experiences aren't the most pleasant (which I would substantiate base on personal experience riding public transit in California) and more importantly, it's mostly taken by people of lower-income and of color. One of the things that that really stood out to me was when the host of the podcast ask why we only read about innovations as I mentioned in the paragraph before, Higashide replied:

> Thereâ€™s a secret reason why a lot of people in the transportation space focus on technological innovation, and itâ€™s because theyâ€™re shying away from their own responsibility and theyâ€™re hoping that the private market is going to solve the problem. But what private transportation companies have given us are boutique services for the well-off.

Boutique services for the well-off. Those last words really punched at me because I totally agree. I revisited all those dreams I had about a utopian world where I was able to do my work and writing on in a smooth-riding self-driving car with even an intimate corner for my cat the sleep at. Suddenly, I looked out at my window and I see a public bus, driven by the driver who's worked there for 30 years, and people still packed against each other on their way to work.

That's not the world I want to live in.
