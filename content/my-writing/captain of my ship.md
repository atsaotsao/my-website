 Iâ€™m often curious about how intense negative emotions can completely deter a trajectory of the day, especially the motivation and optimism to accomplish certain tasks and goals. I can imagine myself as a captain of a ship, and every day I canâ€™t really control the conditions of the weather and how the ocean is going to flow, but as long as I have my compass and trust in my ability to steer the boat the right way, itâ€™s all going to work out fine. But when something like intense sadness or anger enters the equation, it feels like it doesnâ€™t matter which way the wind is blowing or what the weather is like, the ship simply loses the steam to push forward.

Iâ€™ve always known how easy it is for me to let overwhelming emotions cloud my thinking and prevent me from being my best selves, but itâ€™s more frustrating to know that it has the power to anchor the movement of the ship, to literally stop it in place, from growing, moving, and going somewhere that perhaps sunnier.

The point of sailing this ship is not just learning to deal with the external circumstances but also the internal ones; the ones that can impede our progress, especially at the most inconvenient times. The best way to conquer the sea is to recognize that the journey consists of being able to at least glide through when the ship is at is weakest.
