Company of one is so fun
It's lonely, but don't let it scare you
Sure it means lots of things need to get done
But every day you get to choose.

Choose marketing today 
And you get to explore the art of promoting
It's more about what you say
It's about sharing and enjoying.

Choose sales tomorrow
And you come face-to-face with customers
Whether it's software or even tomato
It's having real conversations, nothing glamorous.

Choose design later
And you get to swim in designs and colors
Tap into what speaks to you, ignore the hater
It's one place you sometimes ignore the numbers.

Company of one isn't for everyone
It's challenging, but don't let it stop you
Yes it's not everyones idea of ambition
But boy is it fun, if only you knew.
