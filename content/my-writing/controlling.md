 When you see the word "Controlling" what comes to mind? I picture an ex-manager who was a typical micro-manager who criticizes every little thing that I do. I picture an ex-girlfriend of one of my best friends who had to know where he was at all times. It has such a negative connotation because there is almost no worse feeling than being in a suffocating environment where your freedom is limited by external control. 

But the need for control is innate to every single one of us. In fact, in his 1981 book *The Sense of Wellbeing in America*, author Angus Campbell found that:
> Having a strong sense of control in one's life is a more dependable predictor of positive feelings of wellbeing than any of the objective conditions of life we have considered.
> Being in control makes us happy and fulfilled, it's as simple as that. In fact, the bad days that I have can always be attributed to a feeling of losing control in some shape of form, especially in a life where there are so many things out of our control and the wisdom lies in being okay with them.

I don't blame anyone for being "controlling" because I'm starting to understand the severity one exhibits it is just another reflection of what is lacking internally. In my own coaching practice, I am hoping to restore some control in one's life by being able to be in control of an idea, and a product that one build, design, and markets all by him or herself. I also hope to use no-code automatons to help individuals take control of tiny workflows that can improve their lives even if it's minutes or hours of time.
