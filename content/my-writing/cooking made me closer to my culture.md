 Having spent my entire living in metropolitan cities like Taipei, Los Angeles, and now in New York, I'm always been aware of how privileged I am when it comes to access to food; especially in Taiwan. When every kind of affordable food is available to you in less than 5 minutes of a walk and cheaply, it made me realize how unbelievable caring and intentional it was that my mom and my grandmother always made sure to prepare home-cooked meals. Compare to others, my food memory isn't as strong as my episodic ones around people, but I could always remember the flavors and the vibes that came with it. Whether it's the famous dumplings that my grandma made every year for Lunar New Year or my mom's chicken stew with tofu, it always reminds me of so much joy in the air. As the weather starts to slowly gets colder, and as we think more about home, we knew that we needed to get some Asian flavors that we miss, so I decided to cook the classic Taiwanese Beef Noodle Soup for the first time ever.

I called my mom and got a brain dump of information on how she usually prepares her dish. If you ever asked an Asian woman about her cooking recipe, you would be familiar with what happens next. They don't usually give you a technical breakdown of liquid and meats in terms of ounces, tablespoons, but rather a sequence of information that is often based on "feel" and empirical data. For example, rather than saying you need to cook for this long, she told me to base on how much the water surpasses the beef shank pieces in the pot. There were a lot of hacks that were all rooted in empirical evidence that she's gained through years of preparing the same meal. 

In the end, I prepared and served it on a rainy Saturday evening. I can still remember how the 3 of us (including my girlfriend's big brother) sat around our dining table in silence, savoring every drop without a word being said. At that moment, I knew exactly the love that was conveyed all those years by my parents, and even from my neighborhood noodle spot, I couldn't help but feel closer to a home that I miss dearly.
