 Today in reading the book *The Paradox of Choice*, I came upon a mental model that I found interesting called "counterfactual thinking." The idea is simple when it comes to making a decision, our human imagination gives us the ability to "think about states of affairs that don't exist." This is common where we would frame something like "If only____ then I would have___." If only I invested in dogecoin early, then I would have been a millionaire by now. If only I was more productive in college, I would have been in a better place in my career by now. The fascinating about "counterfactual thinking" is that studies show that most individuals do not often engage in this process spontaneously and that it's usually triggered by the occurrence of something unpleasant and something that produces a negative emotion. The scary thing about it is also the spiral nature of it, where when it begins to occur, it triggers more negative emotions, which in turn triggers more counterfactual thinking, which in turn triggers more negative emotion. Most people can suppress this before they spin too far down the vicious spiral, but those who suffer from clinical depression may not be that lucky

The largest takeaway for me is that this "counterfactual thinking" can be utilized in both directions, upward or downward. Upward is where we imagine states that are better than what actually happened, like the examples I've described above. Downward are when imagined states are worse. Studies have shown that people rarely produce downward counterfactuals unless asked specifically to do so. The lesson for me is, how can I continue to practice "downward counterfactual thinking" so that I can continue to use it to induce feelings of gratitude and content rather than regret?
