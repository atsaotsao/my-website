I'm a little embarrassed to say but my biggest win of the day has been cracking a small[3-digit luggage lock](https://i5.walmartimages.com/asr/a693d5c2-2ffc-4121-ae2c-836bf9d2118c.5e06ed2dbd62a020eff5fff277915591.jpeg?odnHeight=612&odnWidth=612&odnBg=FFFFFF). While my partner was doing some cleaning, she found this tiny black lock where she had absolutely no recollection about where it's from or what the combination was. I just so happened had finish building a fun experiment using no-code and was just in the mood of looking for a challenge, so I took on to crack my first ever lock. 

Since it's a 3 digit lock, with numbers 0-10, it means that there are 10 X 10 X 10 = 1000 possible combinations for the lock so I knew there was no way I was going to do that. After doing a little research, I realize that the general idea is to apply constant outward pull force on the ring part of the lock in order to slowly discover whether each combination could allow the lock to open one level at a time. What I initially assumed to be a 10-minute task of patiently turning and listening to the "click" that indicates that something is happening turned out to be a much more difficult task. With the dial being so small, I quickly realize how difficult is to not just listen but also feel when something is working as it should. 

But when there's a will there's a way. After at least 40 minutes of tinkering, pulling and pushing, and with my two fingers on the verge of blistering, I eventaully cracked it. It absolutely meant nothing, but I'm reminded of the little and big things I can accomplish when I put my mind to it. And that to me is priceless.
