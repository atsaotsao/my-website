 In my journey in rediscovering my creativity, really made me think about my journey after college and what led me to temporarily forget about it. I thought about the importance of a social and work environment that if not foster creativity at least encourages it and it boiled down to one clear line for me: _a space that encourages creativity is one that always makes you feel like you‚Äôre an important member of a collaborative experiment that is tolerant of failure._

Those words keep ringing in my head. I realize that it‚Äôs because time and time again I‚Äôve seen the failure of it not just in the work environment but in relationships between loved ones, family members, and even friends. I thought back to so many glimpses, not just from my own experiences but from even observing others, where tiny sprouts of creativity get stifled because of the pressure of conformity, of the following authority, of doing things ‚Äúright‚Äù, of accommodating to the metrics of meritocracy, and of strong outward external opinions that easily influence us to veer off of exploring the potential of what creativity means to us and how it ultimately relates to problem at hand.

I‚Äôve made a promise to myself this year: I will not deprioritize the exploration of my creativity anymore. It‚Äôs my competitive advantage and I will go to the ends of the earth the continue pushing the boundaries of it.
