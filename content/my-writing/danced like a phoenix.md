 Last night I danced like a phoenix
I can't explain it, but it was to the song [*undir*](https://open.spotify.com/track/3u2R3fpfSNwvEWDzSVcXVS?si=2e691c00a2094514). 
I was having an emotional day and in the living room by myself,
and as soon as the drums came in, I felt my body leap
I waved my arms loudly and expressively, 
alternating between a flow and a powerful pose
as if I'm doing dance and kung fu.
The whole time I had my eyes closed,
So I didn't even know what my body looked like,
but all I could feel is my heart pumping, my breath becoming,
and my body and mind flying. 

I've been having more moments like these
And its allowing me to realize how to integrate dancing
Into my own life to not just process difficult emotions
But also move through them and allow them to flow through me and over me.
