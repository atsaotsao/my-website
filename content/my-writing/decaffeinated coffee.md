 Nothing energizes me more than
a cup of decaffeinated coffee late at night. 

As someone who no longer drinks coffee
to give myself a boost at the start of day,

This new indulgence is the perfect companion,
to enjoying the sweetness and serenity of the evening.

Even on this Saturday, 
where I sit in the dining room alone

Each sip reminds me of more than just comfort,
it reminds me of the life I share with my partner.

I taught her about the bitterness of coffee,
but she educated me about the delightfulness of desserts.

On some nights just like this,
We would eat cake, cookies, chocolate, but not candy (too sweet for me).

We'll pair it with this decaffeinated cup of coffee,
and some days it's just exactly what we need.
