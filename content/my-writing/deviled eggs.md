 My life partner is a big fan of deviled eggs. If you haven't had this dish before, the idea is pretty simple. After completing at least a dozen eggs, you separate the egg yolk from the egg white, and for the egg yolk you beat it until its creamy and mix in flavors like mustard Worcester sauce, then you pipe them back into the egg white. It's simple, it's delicious, and really convenient when it comes to potluck parties. Ever since she decided to make it for a potluck party we were attending, she realize how it can be her "thing." With only three repetitions, she is now not only confident about her abilities to make this dish, but she is also thinking about trying to innovate by combining some Asian flavors with what is traditionally a western dish. 

I told her, the framework of this progression is very similar to the best ways to become better in our skills. Sometimes all it needs is a little curiosity and something that pushes us to try it. And through repetition and consistency, you suddenly find yourself becoming good at something that you've never even imagined. Now, she can make a dish that she enjoys for herself and her loved ones whenever she wants. 

Go find your deviled eggs dish and make it happen!
