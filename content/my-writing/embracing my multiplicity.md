Living alone in Southern California in August reminded me of a deep part of me that I have always scared of embracing: how random, wild, untamable, multi-faceted, multi-tiered and beautiful my creativity is. And what it feels like to allow that part of me to be the driver of my life.

On a day where I give myself permission to let go of the worries of a trying to survive in world where money is the number one source of driver, I find myself flowing like a river, to all these streams that makes me feel so alive.

I wish you can hear the jazz. It sounds like me dancing, cooking, checking email, journaling, painting with ink, writing, walking around and saying hi to trees, playing piano, archiving my grandpa's artifacts, building this website you're reading on, preparing for a workshop, working out my upcoming group coaching offer, and all the random bits of stillness, silence, smiling, and often paired with music, podcasts, audio books, physical books, and a Netflix movie I play in the background as I multitask. 

To many on the outside, it looks like a kid who's not focused. Who has too many hands in too many buckets with too many interests.

"‰∏âÂàÜÈêòÁÜ±Â∫¶" , as my dad would put it (translated as "three minute of heat" ).

My multi-creative self was made to feel scattered and even as unproductive. 
What's even more confusing is that I've read books on ADHD or Neurodivergence and my divergent ways of being doesn't seem to be captured by the criteria of DSM-5.

All it made me feel is just odd. An outlier. Someone with somethings that need to be fixed.
So in my early twenties I try to swing hard the other way. 

I learned the art of google calendar (iCal will always be my first love).
I consumed endless amount of productivity tips and self-help books, more than you can ever imagine.
It pairs nicely to the path of working in tech because I also became that guy who used all the productivity tools. Like all of em, Thanos inifinity gauntlet style. 

And going further in becoming a PM at these tech company reinforced that identity. Now I even had a six-figure salary to validate that this version that I was becoming was "better" and therefore more accepted. 

And that deeply creative self? 

He just kept getting buried and buried deeper. The world didn't really need him to come out to be an "adult" or to make money so he just kept shrinking. 

If it wasn't for pandemic, being unemployed, for almost losing my parter of many years, and all these twists and turns of life that I had the privilege of experiencing, then I don't know if I would even be able to hear him that clearly. 

But I finally do.

And I spend every day trying to remind him that I will never abandon him ever again. And I am noticing just how much love, warmth, and colors flowing in and out of my body lately. 

And I don't doubt him anymore. Even this particular space he's been asking from me right here.

I've had newsletters, twitter, IG, podcast, and Youtube and they all feel like arenas for these parts of me to explore. To make space for the rawest and most authentic parts to come out. 

And this feels like the next space. Space I'm not particularly sending to anyone's inbox or promoting. Space that I can just be. 

And maybe, just maybe someone somewhere is peeking into the crevices and can experience some warmth, nourishment, love, guidance, or even inspiration. 

That. That is what always moves me to keep sharing me. 

As always, thank you for being here, and I hope to see you around.
