 Every once in a while I will take a 40-50 minute long subway ride into Manhattan from Brooklyn to run an errand or meet up with a friend. Every time I have that opportunity, I will make sure I will make time to walk and observe a city post-pandemic. On the surface it looks like things are just like they were before, people rushing to work, eating outdoors in restaurants, and people are resuming their day-to-day lives without making that many significant changes, but as I walk from one block to another, I couldn't help but be aware of the empty spaces that now exists; the vacant rooms, storefronts, and offices that probably was there exactly a year ago. 

Seeing these vacant storefronts makes me have a lot of mixed feelings. I always knew that the pandemic highlights "winners"vs. "losers" in terms of who benefits from a significant shift in rules, regulations, and behaviors. The clear "losers" bucket are businesses that rely on physical spaces to operate which include retail, restaurants, and even places like co-working spaces. What makes me sad is the loss of small businesses that wanted to do something with the physical spaces they provide. A younger Andrew would have scoffed at someone for wanting to open a physical store and I'll start going into talking about the advantages of selling things using eCommerce or comparing the capital risks of starting a bar/restaurant vs. starting a software company. But the truth is, physical spaces made with intention are important and I will never take them for granted. 

Doing my own version of guided psychedelic trips has made me more conscious about creating a physical space; one that is by design makes people feel safe, comfortable and ease to be in a state where they share breakthroughs that may even surprise themselves. I could even imagine one day finding my own way to support a physical space that provides that kind of healing.
