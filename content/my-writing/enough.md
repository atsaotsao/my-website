Enough of this.

Enough of that.

Enough of feeling shameful when I wake up past 10 am in the morning and saying to myself, "I'm falling behind"

Enough of glancing down at my phone, checking my text messages, all the while wondering, "My friends don't care about me."

Enough of peeking at my bank account while thinking about all of my peers who have had purchased their first homes already and agonizing, "I am a failure." 

Enough of looking at the mirror and noticing how skinny my arms are, how different my haircut is, and even the color of my skin and obsessing, "I don't look like someone people will respect." 

I've had enough of these voices because they didn't originally come from me, but I made it my own.

I've had enough of the world pressing, shoving, scratching, pinching, nudging, pushing, hammering, kicking, biting, and relentlessly passing on these thoughts at and onto me. 

Because I finally know now, that I am enough.

I am enough.
