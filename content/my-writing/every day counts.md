 I love how I often feel how much and how little time in a day, but I love how a day just starts over. I used to think about how great to have a superpower where you don’t need to sleep, and you’ll have permanent stamina to stay up to do whatever it is you needed to finish, but how challenging it would be for our psyche. Imagine not being able to “sleep on it” and not giving ourselves the most natural way to reset.

I love making the most out of every day, because regardless of how old we are, every day really counts, and I’m grateful for everyone single one of them. It shouldn’t be wasted on us feeling sorry about ourselves or anxious about not being respected or recognized. Ultimately, oftentimes we are the ones who ruin our own days, not the external events that happen to us, or the people around us.

It’s as Seneca the Younger says, “We suffer more often in imagination than reality.”
