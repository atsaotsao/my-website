Often there are days when I look at the technology I have around me and I think about how grateful I am for its existence. My parents live at least 4000 miles away from me, but I never feel they are that out of reach due to FaceTime. The fact that there's a 12-hour time-difference but only a click on the phone away still blows my mind. One time I forgot one of the steps to making my mom signature beef and tomato stew, I could video call her as she's getting her morning coffee so she can walk me through the correct ingredients to use. Imagine walking through that scenario to someone 20 years ago.

If there's one thing I learned about humans, in general, is that we are the most adaptable creatures ever, for the best as well as the worst. We can learn to find comfort in poor living conditions but we can also grow content of more luxurious lifestyles. That's true for technology as well. Today, we have some of the craziest tools at our fingertips. You can pull up almost any song at any time without paying anything, that's insane! Yet, we often complain about internet speeds, poor user experiences, and even interruptions to our daily usage of our favorite apps.

We need to constantly examine our lives to realizes the technologies we take for granted. We are so lucky.
