There is no life without fig trees

Without the sweet sweet juice and magic of spontaneous connections
Of the quiet beauty of an art museum regardless of what art is being shown

Without the summer breeze carrying the ancient aromas of earth

Without the view of Downtown LA skyline over punk-fueled rock. 

This is life.
