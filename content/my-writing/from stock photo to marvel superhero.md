A while ago my friends and I had a discussion around stock photos. The majority‚Äôs opinion about a lot of the stock photo we see is generic, clinical, and lack the emotion depth that excites us. One particular friend was particularly adamant and vocal about her distaste for it by asking loudly, ‚Äúwhy would anyone, especially a model, ever take a job posing for these stock photos.‚Äù I remembered I pushed back saying, the career path of a model + actor + talent is particularly hard with the amount of competition (especially as a POC). Sometimes it‚Äôs about making strategic to keep going, or to maximize publicity without hurting ones‚Äôs integrity and dignity.

Simu Liu is the leading actor and protagonist for the recent Marvel film, Shang-Chi, and it was recently revealed that he was at point a model for more than handful of [stock photos](https://twitter.com/svmberg/status/1435766257756753921). Rather than shying away from it, he held it as a badge of honor, and I deeply respect it. We all have our journeys, and if there is more photo proof of who once were, the better!

One day I would love to point to people at the very first product I‚Äôve built, to show how far I‚Äôve come in my personal journey.
