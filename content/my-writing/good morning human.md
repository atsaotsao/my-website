Oh my human, why are you still asleep? 
It's 11 already for christ sake, what the _bleep._ 
My body is so warm from sunbathing 
But what I really need now is some serious head scratching

And yes I've already tried the other one, 
But she's too busy staring a the screen, how fun.
I've peed, I've yawned, and I've finished my bowl of food, 
So please, just get up, and attend to my mood.

Oh I can't wait anymore, I'm going to leap on the bed and meow until you hear me.
I don't care that it's a Friday and that I need to learn to let you be. 
Maybe this time, I need to learn to harness the power of my fierceness; my claws! 
Wait, nevermind! I'm going to spend the rest of my morning chasing after that ball.
