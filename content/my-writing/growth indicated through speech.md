 The most powerful validation of the work I‚Äôve done myself in investing in my own personal growth is when a friend of mine told me that my growth is reflected in the way I speak: not just particularly the words I used or the amount of knowledge I am sharing, but the amount of confidence, positivity, optimism, and enlightenment in the things I share.

I think most people don‚Äôt spend a lot of time listening to their own literal voice as it‚Äôs often an agreed-upon point of anxiety that one doesn‚Äôt like to listen to their own voice. I always kind of agreed with the sentiment until the fall of 2017 when I was had over 100+ rounds of PM interviews to land my next PM gig. Since I noticed that the majority of candidates competing for the same job either have already worked as a PM or had a MBA degree, I thought to myself that one of the competitive advantages that I can have is to outperform others in my interview. To do that, I decided on a hat of a struggling actor to understand what it feels like to go after auditions one after another without feeling any progress is being made. That revelation made me decide to find a way to record all my phone interviews, and I would go back and study the tapes after each session in order to pick out areas I can improve so that I can get to a place where most of my phone interviews (especially when asked the typical opening question of ‚ÄúTell me about your self‚Äù) all resulted to a well-rehearsed and oscar-worthy performance. It was the first time in my life that I subjected myself to listening to my voice over and over again; learning to critique it but most importantly, learning to enjoy it.

Listening to your own sound and voice is one of the most underrated things in life. I‚Äôm often surprised by how uncommon it is for people to record themselves saying something for the sake of reflection, introspection, and even for enjoyment. In fact, how can you expect to be your most authentic self when you don‚Äôt enjoy your literal voice (the vibrations, the pitch, the idiosyncrasies) as well as your figurative voice (the style, the word choices, the storytelling)?
