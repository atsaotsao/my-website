 I learned about the concept of the "Hedonic Treadmill" in college while taking a fun class called "The Science of Happiness." The concept refers to the idea that we mostly remain at a relatively stable level of happiness regardless of the changes we try to do like improving our wealth or even achieving our goals. I also learned about how the range of our happiness, in terms of how high it can go, is often determined by our DNA and our environment. What this means is that there are people who naturally will just be "happier" because their baseline set point of happiness is already pretty high, whereas it could be another person's max level of happiness and it takes a lot of work just to get into that state. 

Thinking about this concept was one of the first times I realize how privileged I was. Perhaps because of my DNA plus how I was raised and the environment I grew up in, I often feel like my baseline happiness is pretty high. It's why I can be so optimistic on most days, while it takes others a lot of mental work and huge sums of willpower to get close to it. 

Knowing that reality, how can I turn back on others who may not be as fortunate as I am? I'm fueled by the almost moral obligation to put on my cape and fly through to help others in need. It's not even about saving others, it's about giving them just enough nudge so they can feel like they are at last on an even playing ground.  Because if I don't help, who else would?
