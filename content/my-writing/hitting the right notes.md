 It's great when you know something about what you're saying is hitting the right notes. You can see it on their face, the way their ears perk up, or their shoulders relax, and the way they look at you with tinge of respect and reverence. As I learn to be a better listener, and learn to give support to others through poignant feedback and big dollops of personalized optimism, I've noticed that I am getting more of these moments and it often makes me feel like I'm doing everything correctly. As an extrovert, it also makes me proud that I am no longer the type of person who would simply say things to fill space because I have this desire to be liked or to draw attention, but rather to serve to guide and empower others.
