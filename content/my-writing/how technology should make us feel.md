I've been more observant recently of how different forms of technology make me feel when I use it.

When I'm using an app, looking at a tweet, or trying out a new app, I really take the time to observe my mood, my body, and even my energy level. In this mini form of more mindful use of technology, I'm starting to notice areas where I realize that I genuinely feel more spirited because of it. It is surprisingly reflected in areas of growth where certain types of social media usages don't summon up the pang of jealousy or competitiveness that starts in my chest that usually does in the past. On the other hand, I can also notice when the algo is doing its thing and I'm pulled into something because I want to continually be distracted or procrastinate on my work.

This form of intentional and mindful use of technological tools around me has made me even more bullish about how to be more intentional about how to fully utilize technology to make our lives better and more fulfilling. At one point in my journey, there was one point where I wanted to give up all digital items and live a life filled with analog items and even be off the grid up in the mountains. This intentional use reminds me of the reason why the young kid was obsessed with reading Wired magazine every monthâ€” his love for technology and what it can do for us will always be prominent as it will always be about how we intend to do with it
