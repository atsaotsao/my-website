My friends often joke about how I like to ask very detailed and piercing questions whenever we have a catch-up session; one friend even teased that he would have to prepare notes about all the things happening in his life when he knew he was grabbing coffee with me. I have also got multiple feedback on my first date that it felt like a "job interview." I used to feel insecure about this trait, and I wondered if I needed to ease back on the intensity and quantity of questions I tend to ask. But over the years of doing that, I came to a realization that people are only uncomfortable with it because they're not used to it in a typical catchup between friends, it often follows the same archetype of conversation. You would start with the obvious and basics, like talking about your boyfriend/girlfriend or spouses, or about work. If conversations around those and adjacent subjects ran out, then you would move on to other things like hobbies, pets, family, fashion, politics, and "Have you seen ___ on Netflix" conversations; but rarely do we ask the real questions that need to be asked. Good friends would want to know whether you are happy or sad lately, and more importantly, specific things that are causing those things. Good friends would want to know what goals you have set your for yourself this day, this month, and this year and how you are doing in achieving them. Most importantly, good friends would want you to be comfortable to reveal any vulnerabilities and anxieties that are bottled up inside that they can be a good listener for. Just as Seneca said:

> "..nothing delights the mind so much as fond and loyal friendship. What a blessing it is to have hearts that are ready and willing to receive all your secrets in safety, with whom you are less afraid to share knowledge of something than keep it to yourself, whose conversation soothes your distress, whose advice helps you make up your mind, whose cheerfulness dissolves your sorrow, whose very appearance cheers you up!"

Next time you're catching up with the friends, try skipping the normal "How are you?", instead, try starting with "What's something that happed this week that made you happy?"
