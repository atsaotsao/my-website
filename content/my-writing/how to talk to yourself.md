 I talk to myself a lot. When I'm starting my day and meditating, I often tell myself to kindly let go of the thoughts when I'm veering too far away from my breathing. When I'm doing my push-ups, I summon a coach-like voice to tell myself to push through two more. When I'm feeling lazy, I tell myself kindly to focus and to rise up to my potential. Even when I'm angry these days, I'm gentle with myself, trying to soothe the beast back to dormancy.

Don't underestimate how you speak to yourself. Whether it's happening in your head or on paper as you're journaling, it's a strong reflection of the way you want to be spoken to. It's also the first step toward truly understanding how you get along with yourself. At the end of the day, everyone wants to hang out with someone who's positive, patient, kind who doesn't project guilt, shame, and anxiety.
