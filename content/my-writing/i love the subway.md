I love riding the New York Subway.

I always feel like I get a front-row seat to a glimpse at humanity and all the good things it has to offer.

On the B Train on Grant Street station, you will often see Chinese and Cantonese grandmas stumbling into the subway cart with their pushcart filled with red-labeled grocery bag; ones you can only get from a specific supermarket in New York's China Town.

On the 4 Train at Union Square station, you will often see the beautiful dance of people gliding by each other, getting off and getting on, all moving quickly to their destinations.

On the 2 Train at Time Square, you will often hear a myriad of languages being spoken from all directions. You feel simultaneously irritated and fascinated by the number of people that are always in the station.

On the L Train to Bedford Ave, you will meet well-dressed individuals, all with a smile on their faces as they make their way for their date; a meetup; a party. If you're lucky enough, you'll also meet a blind magician who will show you why perseverance is the foundation to the best kind of magic in life.

And finally, when you're finally on your way back after a long day, even if you're feeling down, you'll look up and realize everyone else is just the same. They had a long day and they are all just going the same way; to go home.
