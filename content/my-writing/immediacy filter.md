I recently read a quote from Kevin Kelly, one of the co-founders of Wired magazine, that made me think about my friends:

> One of the most useful bits of advice I ever got, came from the writer Anne Herbert who said that whenever she got an invitation to do something months away or even a week away, she asked herself whether she would accept the gig/meeting/task if it was tomorrow. The answer was often no. I use that immediacy trick all the time, and it has served me very well.

Living in a big city like New York, there are so many choices to how you spend your time. The biggest side-effect of that is that people often have trouble committing to do things, or some adopt an infuriating behavior of canceling last minute.

On top of the plethora of events and spectacles that happen on a daily basis, the emergence of some technology tools has also made bailing on commitments too easy, aÂ [New York Times article](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/16/fashion/making-plans-schedule-free-time.html)Â from a few years ago wrote. "There's no worse feeling than having your friend bail on your housewarming party, and you go to their Instagram story to find them at a bar with other friends" yelled one of my friends just the other day. Don't be that person with the reputation of "being flaky." Remember the immediacy trick and don't over-commit yourself. When in doubt, always listen to your whole body yeses.
