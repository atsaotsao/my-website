I write to breath, to think, to dance, to move through complex gnarly emotions, and transmit my inner world.

What lives here are my rawest parts of my words. Less manicured, polished, and conventional than anything I would share on a social media platform or share via a newsletter. 

They come in a form a #thought with the intention of turning them into a #essay (still working on writing long-form).

Or through more abstraction in a #poem.

Writing is one of the vehicles for #gratitude practice for me, and channeling the #motivation with myslef and others to move through hard days. 

I hope you can find some inspiration, solace, or resonance in anything I share below:
