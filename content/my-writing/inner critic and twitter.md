I don't know about y'all but being here on Twitter/X has taught me a lot about my inner critic. 

There were times where I would scroll and see people's  product launches and successes and I will feel the knot in my stomach that felt like envy but also the guilt of not doing "enough"

Looking back now, I realize that it was always trying to teach me something. 

It's teaching me to unlearn this tendency to compare myself to others in order to determine my self worth. 

And it was always inviting me to rise above it all, and find a path that was meant for me to focus on. 

Now I don't hear the inner critic as much anymore, and I've noticed how much easier it is to just show up, create, share, and be me. 

So what about you? What are still aspects of being on here (or other social media platforms) that brings out your inner critic?
