“I always wish I can read and write and more”

I heard someone said at a party today, and I had to stop myself from running over to say to them, “You can! You can start tomorrow, and have you heard about Cowriters.app?” I heard this so often where people have these aspirations and goals in life that they view as a big empty checkbox on a bucket list, but the truth is that by framing it like that only make it harder tI accomplish those things.

As cowriters, a lot of are fans of James Clear especially of his book Atomic Habits. One of things that always stuck with me is how he approached the idea of setting goals. He wrote,

> Achieving a goal only changes your life for the moment. That’s the counterintuitive thing about improvement. We think we need to change our results, but the results are not the problem. What we really need to change are the systems that cause those results.

I remember reading those words and it struck me as a lightning, where I had so many examples of achieving a goal that seems no longer relevant to my life now. A perfect example was running a half marathon. I trained for months and months to strive to run my first ever half-marathon in under 2 hours. I managed to that goal, but after the race, I never continued a sustained habit of running anymore.

The beauty of this realization is to know that it’s never too late to start creating our own personal systems, and you can start right here.
