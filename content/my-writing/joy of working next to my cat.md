There is a deep inexplicable emotion of joy and safety
When I'm at my desk, doing internet things like coaching clients, writing, or even building and I see my cat just laying on the table next to me. Every time I see her, even those she is just a feline creature that only gives me occasional meows as feedback, but it has made all the difference in my entrepreneurship journey. 

They say one of the hardest things about being a solopreneur is how lonely it feels. Sure you can find communities that can give you the support you need, but day in and day out you still feel like you have to tackle all the issues yourself. From sales to marketing, building to admin tasks, all fall on your shoulders and no one else. But when I look over at my lovely cat, I at least feel less alone. I'm reminded of all the living things I care for.

I may even go as far as say without my cat, I may not have been able to last in this entrepreneurship game so far.
