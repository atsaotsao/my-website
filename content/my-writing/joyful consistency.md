 It's always reliable to trust your internal compass and do things that bring you joy, but most things in life don't often bring you joy on the first go. If you haven't read in a while, picking up a book often feels tedious. If you never meditated ever, sitting still for even 5 minutes feels like torture. If you are used to eating fast food all the time, eating a salad brings you more pain than sustenance. If you are just starting to learn a language or instrument, I'm sorry, but you're going to sound like ass. 

The truth about a lot of these things is that the joy kicks in later. The joy kicks in after you've applied some consistency, and naturally developed a rhythm where you feel more comfortable, more confident, and more skillful in what you do. That's always the trick. The more you do, the more joyful it gets. Some things take longer than others, but its a little hack to remind yourself to keep at it.
