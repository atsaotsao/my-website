 My partner teaches fourth-grade and I learn a lot of what kids are like these days just by listening to her stories. There was one in particular that stood out to me which was the story around her students and eye-contact. One time a student of hers was giving a presentation in front of the class and instead of sitting quietly and respectably hearing what he had to say, the kids were all loud, talking to each other, and making jokes. Furious about what was unfolding in front of her, my partner gave a lecture about showing respect and asked the classroom, "By a show of hands, how many of you, if you were standing up here giving a presentation, would you NOT want your classmates to show you respect by NOT sitting quietly and NOT making eye contact?" What surprised her was how the majority of the student raised their hand. When investigated further, they all expressed how they would prefer their peers to not make eye-contact with them as they all feel more comfortable and less nervous about it. 

What shocked me about this story is how it already validate some of the fears I have about kids in the upcoming generations. I knew that COVID had a large impact on kids because not only were they robbed of learning opportunities within the classrooms but also out of them. When students are just hanging out, the social lessons we learn are so pivotal to us navigating the external world in the long term. The fact that kids get anxious just by someone trying to make eye-contact with them makes my heart break a little. These are also the same kid who have no problem spending all of their free time laughing while scrolling mindlessly through TikTok videos. 

Sometimes it's hard to not be jaded about what technology has done to exploit the attention of not just users, but especially of kids. It's one area that still continues to fuel me to create a world where technology is not built to take advantage of the traits of addictive behavior but instead actually propel us to greater heights by complementing the strengths we already have and assisting us in the most difficult tasks.
