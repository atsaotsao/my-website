 I've learned a lot about myself ever since I decided to draw for 30 minutes every day. 

It hasn't been the easiest habit to stick to because drawing definitely feels indulgent and I usually do it as one of my wind-down activities before going to bed. But it's been so much more than therapeutic for me; it has allowed me to understand myself on a deeper level. In drawing my favorite kind of improvisation and wavy kind of abstract art, I realize that as a being, I simply like to fill space. I noticed that in all my drawings, I have a tendency to make sure I fill the entire page as quickly as possible. I combine my craving for simply wanting to play where I let my hand just go wherever it wants to go, with consistency where I could try to create the same patterns over and over again, and finally trying to create an overall piece that has aesthetic and spiritual value. It's been a fantastic whirlwind of fun to look up after my 20/30 minute to look at what I've done and even decide critically what worked vs not. At this point, I've almost done with my second notebook. I can't think about how cool one day these notebooks can be shown as part of my "retrospective" in an art show. 

That vision is enough for me to just simply continue doing this. Not for an audience but for being the better version of myself. It brings a smile on my face that a younger Andrew would be so happy to see this side of me.
