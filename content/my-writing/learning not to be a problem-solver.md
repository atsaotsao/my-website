Ever since my depression in college, what I didn't realize is that I became the ultimate problem solver. I saw what my bottom looked like, and I took on every challenge and personal development obstacle I can find and tried to solve it and overcome it, but I did become better for it. But at the same time, it took me a while to realize being that a problem-solver isn't always the best thing. In my work as a PM, I was heavily rewarded. I could go from department to department, executive to executive, and pitch myself as someone who could solve all their problems. During remote work time, this meant I would often work way into the night simply because I genuinely enjoyed solving these problems. In relationships, I would also always seems to have the answers. I would give advice after advice, thinking to myself that I am always helping. 

It took me a while to realize the same skillset that allowed me to grow so much and allow me to climb out of my depression over the years, also gave me a huge blindspot in terms of who I am to myself and others. It took me a while to learn that often times friends don't need someone who can solve their problems, they need someone to hold space for them and let them be while knowing there is someone who cares and is willing to share some perspective. Same for my partner, I quickly learned it's so important to ask "Do you want solutions or do you just want to talk about it out loud?" before I say anything else. And as for myself, the moment remove this invisible label and expectation of myself to problem-solve, I notice how my back is so much lighter and how easy it is for me to accept the world as it is and just be. 

I'm proud to say the version of me today, is so so much more than just a problem-solver.
