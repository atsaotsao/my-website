Whenever I feel overwhelmed
I picture myself playing a video game
And all I have to do 
Is to beat it level by level
To get to the destination

I see myself as a special warrior
With a whole inventory of weapons
That I've picked up over the years
to tackle the different monsters
The trick is battling smart

And I also have some magic up my sleeves
When there is a naughty boulder 
blocking my way to beyond
I can shoot out fireballs
And clear it all away

The point of the video game
Is to enjoy the process
It's not just about the bosses
But the gems and experience I gather
On my way to finishing line.
