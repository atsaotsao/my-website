 My partner is a perfectionist, and it has she's definitely taught me a lot of about the struggles of working and living with one, especially when paired with someone like me. As someone who's impatient, I lived my whole life learning how to get things done quickly, naturally make mistakes, but finding the fastest and most productive way to iterate, improve, and keep moving forward. But the way I function comes directly clash with expectations of a perfectionist because at those exact moments where I can accept mistakes, with things being a little unstraight here and there, a perfectionist like my partner cannot accept them and would often find the compulsion to point out and even criticize me for those mistakes. This exact interaction between our two types of being has been one of the most common forms of frictions that leave both of us feeling misunderstood, unseen, and overall finding frustration when there's a need for collaboration.

Working with her has taught me a lot about how important it is to learn to work with others not like yourself, especially when your perspectives in life go almost exactly opposite to how you approach things. It takes more than just empathy, but deep levels of patience and willingness to be open. We're only a few months away from our 6 years anniversary, and I'm still learning. It's not always easy, but I still feel humbled to be a student of patience and I intend to further master it this year.
