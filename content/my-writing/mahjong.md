One of my favorite ways to spend a weekend night is to get together with three of my friends, we sit in a square table, and play a 144 tiles-based game called Mahjong. It's a complex game of wit, luck, and patience. TheÂ [goal of the game](https://www.thesprucecrafts.com/how-to-play-mahjong-411827)Â is simply to create a full hand of tiles (14 or 16 tiles depends on the version you're playing) with the right set of combinations. Recently, I even designedÂ [a guide to scoring in](https://gumroad.com/l/mahjong)Â Mahjong for people who already understand the basics and just want to learn the different variations to scoring.

Everything I knew about the game I learned from my grandparents. I remember spending almost every Saturday afternoon at my grandparent's house, in a room specially made to play Mahjong in. You could always hear the clattering of the Mahjong tiles bumping into each other, mixing with the sounds of laughter from people winning. It was in those moments that I learned the most about my grandparents. I learned about the stories about how they got to Taiwan. I learned about the struggles they went through when they were chased out of China during theÂ [Cultural Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Revolution)Â and fled to Taiwan to find a home; a sanctuary.

Today, even when I'm sitting in a different Mahjong table almost 8,000 miles away from my grandparent's home, I still think about them. I think about all the memories imprinted in each of the tiles and it makes me feel connected to my family and culture, even though my identity has become more and more Americanized over the year.
