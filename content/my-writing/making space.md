 Lately, I’ve been thinking about the concept of “making space.” The idea really encapsulates some of the biggest lessons I’ve learned in the past year. Living in a big city like New York, you really understand how precious literal physical space is. Whether it’s renting an apartment (rent per square foot), the amount of space you have on a sidewalk, personal space in a subway, or in restaurants, all remind you that space is a limited commodity that we’re all just temporary holding, passing by, or renting, hopefully, one day being able to own our own. But this idea of “space” also applies to time and interest.

We rarely think about how the park makes the space for us to enjoy the beauty and life source despite being in the hustle and bustle of a cosmopolitan city. I’ve seen how creative institutions and venues create the space for self-expression, and some allowing free entrance. I’ve recently learned from my girlfriend that she’s been to a Brooklyn waxing facility that created the most incredible safe space where the lady makes you feel like your female genitalia is the most beautiful thing in the world.

We also rarely think about time as space. I’ve thought about how much time I’ve spent in the past in meetings (some still argue as a necessary evil), but how we don’t often intentionally make space for our personal development, our creative pursuits, and finally for expressing our love.

Here’s a reminder to make space for yourself; both your current and future self. Then make space for the ones you love and care about. When there’s leftover, make space for ones that are less fortunate than you, because no one else will carve out space for them unless we start.
