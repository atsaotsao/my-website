As everyone is talking about "social distancing" I want to share a quote read online which a Jewish rabbi shared with his synagogue (full quote fromÂ [twitter)](https://twitter.com/thislouis/status/1237923746775629824):

> Every hand that we don't shake must become a phone call that we place.Every embrace that we avoid must become a verbal expression of warmth and concern.Every inch and every foot that we physically place between ourselves and another, must become a thought as to how we might be of help to that other, should the need arise.

My biggest worry about the immediate and ripple effects of this current pandemic is not the number of people that get infected, it's all the other daily realities that are happening as a result of it. Events are being canceled. Film releases are being postponed. Restaurants are closing. People are losing jobs left and right. At the end of the day, there will be more unemployment, more unhappiness, and more fear and division will be sowed throughout the country and the world, and after all this is over, people will start pointing and blaming each other while the low-socioeconomic status households will suffer the most.

When I read that quote, I think about the bare-minimum things I should do both during and after the pandemic is over. This means maintaining the close connections I have with my friends, family, and community even when I may not be physically there with them. This means I need to find different ways to express and share warmth with people I care about. This means finding ways to help others, especially the ones who are suffering the most. This means creating products and businesses that empower people even at times of isolation and recession.
