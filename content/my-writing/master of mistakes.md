One label I've enjoyed owning is calling myself the "Master of Mistakes." With the combination of my impatience, my instincts to act first, to be bold and even defensive, I've definitely made then more than my fair share of mistakes along the way. Being in a close relationship with a perfectionist has definitely shed some light in terms of how naturally un-detail-oriented I am. But without being completely conscious about what I've been doing the past century, ever since I developed a thicker skin and more confidence around the style of how I work, I've became the king of iterations; making mistakes over and over again and on a never ending hike of bettering myself. It's also in these iterations that I've somehow discovered more tools and frameworks of personal development that I often find myself being baffled that others in my age find them too abstract or inapplicable to what they're trying to do.

I'm proud to be the "Master of Mistakes." All my mistakes have made me who I am, and it led to someone I love looking at the mirror at.
