I think a lot of us are afraid of our own creativity. 

The depth, the power, and the aristry that comes iwht it.

I know I was.

For htel ongest time I blamed the world for not allowing me to feel "creative" because of the boxes labels that comes iwht it. 

but I realize I was mostlyangry, and sad that I was so scared to full embrace these parts of me. 

Even today, I'm scared that folllo0wing the flow ofm y creativity will take me away from being a "grown up" or being more "professional"

But on thing I learndd from making art the past 4 years is that the process brings out an aliveness in me that I'm only starting to put into words. 

The kind of alivenes that although doesnt come with quantifiable dollar ammounts ofr ROI< gives me a sense of aabudnacne that permeates and spills to all parts of my life.

I just want more people to hear this from me in tehdepths of my heart. 

Making art, or following your artistyr, makes your life feel more full, more magiclal, and more You.

So what are you waiting for?


### ChatGPT version

I think a lot of us are afraid of our own creativity.

The depth of it.  
The power.  
The artistry that comes with letting it move through us.

I know I was.

For the longest time, I blamed the world for not giving me space to feel “creative”—for the boxes, the labels, the pressure to be someone else.

But underneath the blame, I was mostly just sad.  
And scared.

Scared to fully embrace these parts of me.  
Scared that following the flow of my creativity would make me seem less “professional,” less like a grown-up.

But after four years of making art…  
one thing I’ve learned is this:

The process brings out an aliveness in me  
that I’m only just beginning to name.

An aliveness that doesn’t show up in dollar signs or ROI—  
but gives me a kind of abundance that spills into everything I touch.

And I just want you to hear this, from the deepest part of me:

Making art—  
or simply following your artistry—  
will make your life feel more full, more magical, and more _you_.

So what are you waiting for?
