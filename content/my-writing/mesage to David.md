Here's what I have in mind btw (would love to hear your thoughts & input! 😎):

Start each week with leaving a voice note just sharing the Dare/Bold thing you want to do this week. This can be for whatever you want (around life, business, relationships, creativity). We can also share on this voice note any asks for each other that can help with doing that thing! Example: "Hey, I might reach out mid week if I need to borrow some of your belief in me so I can use the extra oomph to do the thing!"

Next: Do the thing!! 

We end the week (anytime friday - Sunday) by sharing whatever wins, losses, takeaways, or whatever emerged in the process. 

I plan to try this for the month of April.

Thoughts?
