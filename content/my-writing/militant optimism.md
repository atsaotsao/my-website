When I first got into working in tech, I definitely adopted whatÂ [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/wired25-louis-rossetto-tech-militant-optimism/)Â would call militant optimism: the kind of optimism that believes that technology can tackle almost any big problem in the world; even in very tricky spaces like mental and behavior health. After working inÂ [Groups](https://joingroups.com/)Â for a little over two years on the product team, my views have definitely changed a little.

At Groups, we offer a medical assistant treatment which combines offering proven models of group therapy treatment (just like Alcoholic Anonymous) with scientifically proven medication that prevents the feeling of withdrawal, like Suboxone. When I first joined, I was a bright-eyed PM ready to tackle this opiate addiction issue with technology. We brainstormed about creating digital tools, about developing a mobile app. There were even discussions about maybe taking advantage of the emerging virtual assistant tools like Alexa to develop simple de-escalation tools that our members can utilize it themselves when they feel the urge to use drugs again.

As part of my onboarding experience in my first few months, I traveled to Cincinnati OH so I can sit in a few group therapy sessions, and it changed my life. Our members would usually take turns sharing their stories. Some talked about the friends they lost and children they are still trying to win back. Others talk about the struggles they feel at work, at home, at a bar with their friends. It was at that moment that I felt the magic in the air; there were melodies of empathy, sadness, joy, anger, and optimism all flowing around in the air. The counselor was the conductor, skillfully directing the flow of the conversation and finding the right balance between letting silence simmer and asking the right questions. A member even turned to me and said: "You know, I've tried to quit for 9 times already, this is the only one that worked for me." I was stunned. I remember feeling swells of emotions as I tried to hold myself from tearing up. I had witnessed a kind of pure human interaction that technology will never be able to replicate. A kind of magic that no light digital tool, no web app, no chat-bot, no high-definition video cam, no human-like robot, and no futuristic hologram projection can ever replicate and reproduce.

I knew at that moment, the best thing I can do as a technologist to make sure these members come back to their weekly group therapy treatments, where the real magic happens.
