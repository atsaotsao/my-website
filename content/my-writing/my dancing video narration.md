We’ve all heard the phrase: _Dance like no one is watching._

But as we grow older, it feels harder to actually do that.  
Not just to dance, but to live freely, authentically—without fear of judgment.

For the first 25 years of my life, I was scared.  
Scared to move my body freely because I wasn’t a dancer.  
Scared to draw because I didn’t think I was an artist.  
Scared to write because I wasn’t a writer.  
Scared to make music because I wasn’t a musician.

I let the fear of not being ‘good enough’ stop me.  
But here's what I’ve learned: you don’t need a title to create.  
You don’t need perfection to express yourself.

Dance. Draw. Write. Sing.  
Not for anyone else, but for you.

Because life is too short to be anything but free.
