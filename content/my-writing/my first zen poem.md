I came early to the temple
Cold and wet from the rain
Sat alone
Enveloped in the warmth of silence
I realized I was right on time

The sounds of mouths drinking hot tea
Reminds me of the gurgling of the creek
Where the river flows and flows
That river is me.

The water is clear and serene
And it carves courageously forward
It has left behind
other bodies of water
And it's now all alone.

Alone but not lonely
The water greets the world
The land, the ants, the strawberry
He is ready for it all.

Sitting in a half circle
talking about Japanese poetry
Is not where I imagine
Where I will meet a celebrity

I sat and I cry
The sadness of friendships
And the parting
Is part of life.
