Today I helped our VP of Marketing interview for a candidate applying for the position of Digital Marketing Manager, and as I was asking them a list of questions I had prepared beforehand, it bought me back to two years ago when I was on the other side of the phone call aggressively interviewing for Product Manager positions. After speaking to a mentor, I created an incredibly detailed and process-driven method (which I will write about in a post another day), but the number one thing I learned about being successful at interviewing, and most importantly, making sure you are memorable to people who spoke to you is this:

**Turn your interview into a conversation.**

This seems like something very simple and easy to do, but it's surprisingly harder than it sounds. Picture the structure of a typical interview, especially one on a phone call, it usually starts with the interviewer asking you, "Tell me about yourself" or "What's your story?", then have 2 or 3 specific follow up questions about specifics of your experience and your achievements. Then, the interviewer might ask a few more questions to gauge the culture fit. After the soft-ball questions are done, the interviewer would now ask you a question designed for you to think outside the box, use critical think and problem solving but most importantly be able to articulate how you're thinking through the problem. Only after all that does the interviewer now ask you if you had any questions for them.Next time in an interview try this: don't wait for the very end of your interview to ask all the burning questions, ask them during and between the questions the interviewer is asking you. Here's an example: "Tell me about your experience with a product from ideation to launch". "That's a great question, I'll tell you about the time I built the app for blah blah. At first, I did this....worked with blah....finally we were able to achieve blah, now I noticed that you guys are looking to build an app, what stack are you guys using and what are you guys currently struggling with?"

Did you see what I did there? I made sure I had a succinct answer to what the interview threw at me, but I also use it as a jumping board to ask them a question. This technique is so important because of 3 main reasons:

1.  By asking them a question too, you have now disrupted the uneven dynamic of a typical interview where someone asks and the other answers. Now you've created a better foundation for more genuine dialogue.
2.  Just like when you are catching up with friends, in order for you guys to feel connected, there must be an ebb and flow, especially in the back and forth of questions and answers. The moment you start asking the interviewer questions, you will notice that the interviewer will often be caught off-guard but eventually ease into a "lets-have-a-casual-conversation" mode a lot faster.
3.  Lastly and most importantly, always remember you are interviewing them as much as they are interviewing you. Always ask more questions to find out more about the job, the company, the team, because there is always a reason why they're looking for someone and sometimes the reasons are bad, and only through questioning do you start noticing the red flags.
