I donâ€™t think Iâ€™ve ever been the best at something. Growing up, whether itâ€™s my grades, my writing, my athletic abilities, and even my skill level in video games, I never consider myself the best at something. But the funny thing, Iâ€™ve also usually above average at most things. Iâ€™m the guy that would be chosen early for the sports team because I was fast. I was chosen for trivia teams because I was reliable. And for video games, even though I donâ€™t have the time to play as other kids did, I was also good enough to keep up with everyone. I was incredibly proud of being a powerful generalist. But most importantly, I realized I loved being not the best.

When I surround myself with people who are more skillful than me, Iâ€™ve learned that I am able to improve myself self so quickly. Because I was skillful enough and picked up things quickly, I also never gave up on anything quickly and could always find joy in these different categories. When I find the perfect balance of using the emotions of losing to my peers to fuel my competitiveness and not let it lead to negative emotions like jealousy, Iâ€™m able to grow quickly.

I love not being the best, because Iâ€™m always learning more lessons of being humble because there are also more to be learned.
