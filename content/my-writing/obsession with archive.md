If you have not explored a digital archive yet, you have not lived. Take theÂ [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/), for example, the big daddy of all online archives, it contains archives of web content, books, video audio, old software, video games, images, and more. I often find myself spending hours meandering through the different collections of content to glimpse into a different time period, to kill boredom with free emulations of retro games, or sometimes just to find a little inspiration.

My obsession with these archives had started me on a path in thinking more about whether there is more value to them than just being an archive the way we think about storage or backup. I've explored a handful of digital archives, mostly published by institutions like museums, and I've noticed that they're often built with the intention of being used internally for cataloging or by researchers who may already have a search term in mind. However, with a more accessible UI that encourages discovery and even curate an "online" exhibition using archival content, I feel like it would breathe life into things that don't get selected to be on display at the actual galleries and museums, and most importantly, give a wider range of audience access to use, interact, and be inspired by it.

I have some product ideas floating around archives, like a CMS-esque model that makes it easier for smaller institutions with smaller budgets to create a lightweight digital archive that is user-friendly. Currently, I'm building an online directory of free digital archives to test if there is interest beyond just the academic circle to access them.Stay tuned.
