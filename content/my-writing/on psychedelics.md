 I‚Äôve been hesitant to talk about this subject publicly for a while due to the controversial nature of the subject but I want to begin to try to express how it means to me and how it has very significantly changed my life.

Last fall was the first time I‚Äôve ever taken psychedelics, specifically LSD, and I can say for certain that it is the best thing that ever happened to me. In the past decade, I noticed that I started to develop a pretty conservative view around drugs and all kinds of controlled substances. This is probably due to my small exposure to it in college, but mostly from seeing how it affects people around me, and later seeing the absolute worst of it when I was working with people suffering from substance abuse. When you see people living in the rural parts of the U.S, telling you about how their daily fight and struggle is on the spectrum of maintaining functionality in the world where half of their friends have overdosed, of barely working at their construction jobs, and of regaining custody of their kids, it‚Äôs very easy to create the statement in my head that ‚Äúall drugs are evil.‚Äù I unconsciously also decided to put all of them in that same bucket whether it‚Äôs meth, cocaine, ecstasy, heroin, LSD, or shrooms.

It wasn‚Äôt until last year where my girlfriend‚Äôs brother was doing some self-discovery last year and wondered if he needed to return to taking anti-depressants. In his research, he read about the healing capabilities of LSD. It took at least two months after he‚Äôs tried it before I tried it for the first time in the safe presence of my girlfriend, and I discovered a world of new perspectives and healing. I even picked up the book, [_How to Change Your Mind_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36613747-how-to-change-your-mind) and learned about the history of psychedelics.

Since then, I‚Äôve gone on a handful of ‚Äútrips‚Äù and each has uncovered wisdom that would take years of work to get to. I could spend hundreds of words to keep talking about the takeaways, the journey, the experiences, and even talk about the pros and cons of it, but to start the best thing about it is 1) how the nature of it does not damage your body (chemically, it doesn‚Äôt affect other vital parts of your body like your heart or lungs. In fact, even after just one session, you understand how even alcohol damages your body more.) 2) how the nature of the substance forces you to unshackle the mental rigidity in your head and around everything. I was forced to examine how I‚Äôve looked at everything in the world including big topics like growth, love, power, money, and even trauma. It was through that process where I deeply internalized the importance of doing things like meditating every day and since then have even took a small role of a ‚Äúteacher‚Äù to pass on key wisdom to anyone who‚Äôs willing to listen.

It still gives me a little bit of anxiety to talk about something like this in public because I still understand the stigma around it and how I might be perceived. In fact, recently an Asian Tech CEO was [fired for microsoing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl_MuBMvDBI). I want to make space for myself to talk about it more because I‚Äôve even seen how it has healed some wounds around the people closest to me. If you‚Äôre still reading this and curious to learn more about it, let me know and I will be more than happy to share more!
