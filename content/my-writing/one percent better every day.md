Every morning, before I even brush my teeth, wash my face or make myself the first cup of coffee, I would look at the mirror and tell myself this:

"Be 1 % better than you were yesterday."

This is such a simple idea adopted from James Clear's book Atomic Habits, or hisÂ [blog post](https://jamesclear.com/continuous-improvement), that has completely changed the way I framed and approached my daily efforts in changing and improving myself. My favorite aspect of this idea is how EASY it makes everything seems. Oh, I want to be 1% more productive than I was yesterday? Easy! I want to convert 1% more leads than I did yesterday? Easy!Â I want to write 1% more content than I did yesterday? Easy!

The absolutely coolest thing about the daily 1% improvements and its compounding effect is summarized in this punchline:

> If you get one percent everyday for one year, you'll end up thirty-seven times better by the time you're done.

When is the last time you are able to say to someone or to yourself that you managed a year-over-year improvement of 37x?

Well, I plan to this year. I want to be 37 times better than who I was last year. If you are reading this, consider yourself a small investor in my venture, and I assure you that if you plan to keep up and continue to read about progress, you would not be disappointed with your returns.
