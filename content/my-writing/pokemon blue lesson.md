[This](https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/retro-gaming/game-boy/games/products/pokemon-blue-version/10129625.html)Â was the very first Gameboy cartridge that was ever gifted to me along with the Gameboy Color in the atomic purple casing. I remember spending the next 3 to 4 hours completely glued to the game, my brother on one side of the couch me on the other, as we travel with our monster companions to conquer the marvelous 9-bit world ahead of us. When the sun in the physical world has finally set and the dinner is ready, we both press the "Save" button from the start menu and put our Gameboys away for the rest of the night.

It wasn't until the next morning did I discover that none of the progress was saved. At first, I was just mad at myself, for being stupid enough to forget how to save properly. I started a new game, played for an hour a more, and this time I made sure I press save at least 5 times before I close the machine. But when I open it again, the progress was completely wiped clean again and knew that it was caused by a hardware issue. I felt so defeated. I threw the game aside and never attempted to play it again. What's the point of playing a game when there is a 0% chance of finishing it?

Today that very same cartridge is hanged on the wall directly facing where my workspace is. I keep it not only as a reminder of the frustration I felt as a kid, but it also teaches me to never take for granted the ability our minds, as well as modern technologies today, all have to press pause, shut down, then resume the next day.
