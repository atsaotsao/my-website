One of the biggest epiphanies I've had as a late twenty-something-year-old is that I perform better when I'm in an environment that provides more positive reinforcement than negative reinforcement. One of my first jobs, when I moved to New York, was working for women who started a business in 1993 selling jewelry safes. Now, these were not ordinary safes that you would ever encounter in any kind of store, these were safes that are made in Switzerland, customized exactly to clients' requests, and with the cheapest model starting at $35,000. As a business owner and the head of the company, she was a micro-manager who often used blame and fear-based tactics to make sure I hit a monthly quota of sales, and I find myself developing the skills to anticipate her needs and adopted a "stay in the lane" mentality that minimizes risks.

Even though I learned to better complement her management style, I never really did get better in taking criticisms, or tactics of negative reinforcement, and would often take them very personally and would blame myself for having "soft skin". Fast forward three years to 2018, and it was the first time I had a boss that almost completely adopted a style of leadership that utilized more positive reinforcement. He was always ready to absorb all the blame from external parties but was the first to give credit when credit is due for a team member. Something interesting I found about myself was that I noticed I was not only extra motivated to do my work, I find myself to be more creative, productive, and confident, and much more willing to voice my opinions especially around how things could be done differently and better.

The biggest takeaway from working with this boss was that my personality responds not only better to positive reinforcement, but also to particular way of giving complement and criticisms. Because of that understanding, I've also learned to speak to myself in that manner. When I write in my daily mood journal, there's a world of difference between writing "Andrew, you suck you gotta step your shit up man" vs "Andrew, you did achieve your 1% improvement today. You just need to work on this particular area that's given you so much trouble."

**What kind of environments do you prosper in?**
