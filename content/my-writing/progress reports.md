Today I saw my middle school teachers post pictures of themselves from around the time they were teaching me in Taiwan and it made me think about what I was like when they taught me. People always say we're no longer the same people as we are a child, but I've always been deeply fascinated by the thought of finding out just how much of my young selves stayed the same while other parts changed. Have I always been this creative? What kind of potential did they see in me?

Imagine if we could access a collection of all our historic progress reports from all our teachers & professors. What would we learn about ourselves? I reckon I will be able to spot early indicators of my passion and interest that could be a compass to making future decisions. I also feel that it would be the most powerful retrospective to understand past weaknesses and strengths to revalue which ones require additional work while others need to be bought out more.

The biggest takeaway for me is that we cannot control what information we can access to in the past, but we still have time to create "progress reports" for our future selves. This is why I've completely re-evaluated the importance of monthly & annual reviews and hopefully documenting all my growths & lack of growths in an intuitive way to understand to provide guidance to my present and future self.
