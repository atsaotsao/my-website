There's something great about being out and about when it's pouring outside. 
Normally on days when the weather is like this, especially on a weekend, I will most often opt to stay in and enjoy a nice day of reading or working on my projects, but my partner decided to make the trek to a different borough just to support a friend who was doing an open house today. 

But I realize there is something really beautiful about being out when it's just absolutely pouring rain. You notice parts about the city or people you don't normally notice. I saw a couple sitting in "outdoor" seating with cover enjoying afternoon tea, and even though the weather was horrible, they were both having such a lovely time. I also heard a man play a Bach violin concerto at the 2nd Ave subway station beautifully. And at the movement workshop I attended, you can tell everyone who was there *really* wanted to be there. 

Rainy days aren't bad days if you don't see it that way. And I'm starting to understand how to use days like this to shift my perspective and practice seeing the different side of the good in this world and our lives.
