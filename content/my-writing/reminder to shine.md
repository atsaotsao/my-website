 This is a reminder to whoever reading, the importance of shining. Time after time again, I am taught that the best way to create change, to influence, and to even persuade someone is to be a consistent source of light that people can bask in. As someone who's so passionate about finding all the ways to improve myself, I constantly find myself throughout the years to be frustrated with how things are and unwilling or unmotivated someone is willing to change. Even though I always knew that people need to experience certain things themselves in order to find the motivation to do it, but I still get frustrated because I'm always thinking, "Why do you want to make the same mistakes I have? Listen to me. I've gone down that path! Walk this way instead!" But the truth is, no one really wants to be told what to do or how to live their lives, and there's a chance you'll never be able to persuade them. 

So what do you do, if you're like me, that some part of your being still need to get others to understand, not for self-fulfilling purposes, but because you care about them and simply wants to see them become better versions of themselves? After so much trial and error, I discovered that the best way is to become the better versions of ourselves and simply just shine. Take patience as an example, I remember how I was working on my patience through my daily meditation practice and trying to be as patient as possible and one day my partner came up to me and said, "Hey I noticed you are more patient than before and it makes me want to be more patient with you." It was the first time I experienced how by simply shining, we are doing the most effective version of guiding, leading, and helping.
