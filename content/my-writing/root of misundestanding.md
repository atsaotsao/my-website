The root of misunderstanding is due to the difference in perspectives. This sentence is so obvious, but time and time and again I have to remind myself this thought to reinforce just how incredibly easy it is for arguments, disagreement, and even discourse to form when two people are having a conversation.

When there is a catalyst, let‚Äôs say something happened and two people who experienced it got to discussing what just happened, they often start with describing what they saw. They would describe from their angle and use adjectives and verbs that they deemed as most appropriate, and if it was something that caused some frustration, they would do their best to highlight or circle the area that bought forth those negative emotions. But at the very same time, the recipient is doing the same thing, and more often than you would imagine, they experience the same scenario in a completely opposite manner and everything you‚Äôve explained seem like an alien language to them.

One of the ways I am learning to do to always resorting to using a common language, or something that attempts to bridge the distance between the two. So far what seems to work is to be vulnerable and name the ‚Äúthing‚Äù as specific and with as little self-serving bias as possible. The more loops of this I‚Äôve done, the more I realized just how easy anyone and everyone is misunderstood. The best I can do is continue to let it motivate me to be even more open-minded, patient, and empathetic toward opinions that I disagree with.
