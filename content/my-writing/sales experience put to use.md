 I used to work in sales and spend tons of time doing cold calls, client meetings, impulse sales (which basically means door-to-door sales) and most importantly, working in and understanding sales processes. Even know though at that time I knew that my sale skills will eventually put to use even though I didn't really want to create a career in it, it still took me a long time where the investment in those skillets and experience finally feels like they've come to fruition. 

One of my coaching clients is currently going through a process where she is trying to go through a sales reach process to validate an idea she has while picking up consulting work before she decides the direction of the platform she wants to build, and I'm helping her use no-code to build a sales automation workflow and process. It feels incredible to know how my past experiences have created such a strong foundation for me to now do my work even more effectively. 

Something I don't feel like I do much these days is thanking my past self. 
Thank you, young Andrew for those years of being in the trenches working in sales and finding your way. Your hard work wasn't wasted
