 One important concept I learned through my daily meditation is the importance of sitting with it. I am such a reactive person that there are so many catalysts and stimuli in my daily life that it’s so easily pulled into different directions; sometimes causing me to be more emotionally charged and compromised than I want to be. The act of sitting with it, different from sitting in the corner and stewing in the same thoughts that reinforce your beliefs and stance, allow the unnecessary noise to dissolve and you always have more clarity at least around how to discuss it and think about how to improve or move on from it.

The more I sit, the more I realize how hard some sensations are to fight against, Things like our natural tendencies to seek out instant rather than delayed gratification. Things like unconsciously clicking at distraction that we’re wired to “de-stress” with. I’m learning to peel back these things one by one, and it feels like I’m shedding off the skin (painful, but rewarding).

To my future self: I urge you to continue to sit with the most uncomfortable thoughts and emotions you have. It’s all about looking it straight at the eye and sometimes saying,  
“what are you here to teach me?”
