There’s a saying in mandarin: “心靜自然涼”

It’s translated to, “when you’re at peace, you’ll naturally feel cool and at ease.” A lot of us grew up hearing this in Taiwan and I always remember hating the idea of it. I remember being a first grader sitting in an old building built during the Japanese colonial years in the middle of Summer in humid Taipei and when asked about why the air conditioning doesn’t work, the science teacher only told us to sit with it. There was no way you can expect a first grader to hear that and understand what it means.

Today, as I arrived at my bench in the park to start my post-climbing routine, I noticed that the sun was particularly hot today and shining directly at the bench that I normally sit in. This is the exact spot I always come to eat my bagel, meditate, and read in. I’m reminded of that mandarin saying and thought it would be an interesting challenge for my meditation practice to trying finding stillness in the blazing heat.

As I sat there, I definitely felt more in control of the discomfort of being hot and was able to sit with the humid temperatures longer than I imagined. But as time went by, passing 10 minutes, I could feel each sweat bead slowly flowing out of my pores and sliding down. It started with the two sides of my face, and later from the top of my head and slowly across my face; across my eyelids, down the nose bridge, and occasionally even right to my lips where the taste of salt kicked in. I was trying to fight every urge of wanting to wipe the sweat out of my face and in the end, I ended my meditation earlier than I usually would.

Even though it was a less enjoyable meditation experience compared to being in a nice quiet cool room, I loved that I challenged myself with new environments, distractions and sensations. It reminds me that ultimately meditation is all about dealing with stillness and sitting with wherever you are and however you feel. It reminds me of the vastness of terrain I can still explore, with my body and my mind.
