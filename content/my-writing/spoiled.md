Once you enjoy the sweet nectar of the freedom of having a full week's schedule that is owned and controlled by you, you will be forever spoiled. That's what I'm currently feeling. 

Whenever I'm feeling like I'm not making enough progress on particular projects or venture, I think to myself how grateful and lucky I am to be able to do this everyday. My partner and I would often hold hands and walk around our neighborhood on a weekday afternoon, and just feel unbelievably abundant, even though we are still working to make more money to support ourselves. 

I still can't say that I'm figured everything out, but I'm confident that this feeling that I'm experiencing is something I will ever give up on. Maybe until I have a kid. Until then, I'm going to be damn sure I make the most of it.
