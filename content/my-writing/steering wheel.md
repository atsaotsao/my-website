 I always remember those futuristic cars in the movie *iRobot*
They were gorgeous, with smooth white curves of a body
And they floated so effortlessly in a well-lit city and driveway.
But one thing that always stood out to me was how there was a steering wheel,
The driving AI recommended the protagonist (played by Will Smith) to stick with the auto-pilot
While emphasizing how it has reduced traffic-related deaths by a lot
But somehow the steering wheel is still there, taunting you to use it.

I see life just like that in many ways. 
Sometimes it feels like it's easier to just be on autopilot, 
And let the car take me wherever it goes, just like the rest of them.
And it will often maximize the chances of me getting to places in the most optimal and safe way.
But there is always still something about that steering wheel.
Using it could mean more chaos, and my car can swerve as I am still learning how to handle it,
But at the end of the day it will still always feel like I have things in my hands. Even the chaos is mine to own. Mine to drive.
