Over these years I realized that I stopped complaining.
It's so easy to find something to complain about in New York City. We have people of all sorts of rudeness. We have loud noises coming from all directions: from the summer constructions to the cars fighting to get to their destinations. We also have workers who are rushing their way to work and their homes. The subway is always a petri dish of emotions. We have every ethnic group you can imagine spread out over different parts of the city. We have tourists who crowd areas, forcing you to take emergency breaks just so you don't run into them. 

There are so many reasons to complain about everything and anything, but I no longer find a reason to. Even on my worst days, I always realize there is something I can focus on that I can feel grateful for. And the city becomes more beautiful when I put on those grateful glasses.

I like becoming a person that never complains.
