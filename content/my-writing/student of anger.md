 I've been a student of anger my entire life, and I spent a lot of my energy and time in the past few years understanding, studying, expressing, processing, and letting it go. I realize that in many ways it has also made me skillful in observing it in others, and even teaching others to dance with it. 

As I look more closely at peers around me, and their own nuanced ways of expressing their negative emotions I am able to see more clearly what unprocessed anger looks like. I am able to see and understand what a younger Andrew would react to things, and how tightly he would hold onto anger because in some ways that's what he knew, but most importantly, not being able to see how much suffering the anger would bring me and the people around me.

It's weird to be to see progress I've made in this way, but I'm still proud of everything I've done and I just want to celebrate what it took to get here.
