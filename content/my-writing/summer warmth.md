I feel the summer warmth creeping in
Meditating on the patio
It's never completely peaceful as I still live in a city
But at least I'm still greeted by
The beautiful sounds of rustling tree leaves
against the occasional, flirtatious wind.

The warmth is inviting yet it also
a cruel reminder of the passage of time
and another season passes, yet the things are yet undone.
There has been growth, but so are there setbacks
And the seasons can give but they also take.
So far I've lost some joy.

But looking at the tree ahead, 
I always feel inspired. It can lay so bare
one season, just standing there
Yet at another, it's enveloped with life
The birds chirp away
celebrating this miracle.

All is going well, I believe.
Season helps us wilt but they also help us blossom.
They are as unforgiving as they are generous
And so are my emotions
I know that as long as I have my wits
I too, will stand tall again.
