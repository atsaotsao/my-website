The sun rays bounces off the shimmering surface  
Iâ€™ve been here before, but never like this.  
Iâ€™m me, and just little more than before  
The lush mountains hug me, welcoming me with their embrace.

The place is named after celestial entities, yet itâ€™s so close to my grasp.  
The water, taunts me with its rare winter warmth.  
Smell of black tea leaves whiffs up as I bike through.  
This isnâ€™t just a vacation. It feels like an extension of home.

When the new year comes, and Iâ€™m back in the chilly city  
And the closest thing to tranquility is what I can find in my mind,  
I will think back to this moment. To this view.  
To this peace.
