 There is a double meaning to this title. 

One is referring to self-care. When you are taking care of yourself, in the complete sense where you are attuned to all your emotional needs and prioritize it over the demands of our external worlds, you are becoming the biggest winner. You're winning because you are playing the long-term game; you know that by taking care of ourselves, we are essential maximizing ourselves to not just continue be better, but also have the health and stamina to last through the marathon that is our lives.
The second meaning is referring to taking care of others. At the end of the day, if there are days where you like you've been productive enough to achieve some of the goals you've set out for yourself but you managed to take care of a friend, a client, or even your partner, you have to remind yourself how big of a win it is. You are maximizing others ability to run the marathon, and simultaneously maximizing yours because you are also finding allies to your journey.
