 I learned through writing every day that in order to grow and be more powerful, to make something stick in the long term, and ultimately to spread the joy of something so more people can understand is simply talking about it more. I noticed that I have talked about meditation with my mom, at least mention it, in every single phone call I‚Äôve had with her for the past two months.

At first, I talked to her about it because Taiwan is going through a time of quarantine and I knew that she was feeling angsty, and I knew that sitting still would alleviate a little of those emotions. The more I talked about, the more I am aware of the gap in understanding. For one, this idea of mental wellness is now more mainstream in the western culture as perpetuated by the popularity of apps like Headspace and Calm and the handful of wellness companies, but in the East, they‚Äôre still mostly related to spiritual and religious rituals, beliefs, and lifestyles. For one, the idea of going to a therapist has so much negative connotation that no one would ever even consider the idea. And two, the idea of ‚Äúsaving face‚Äù is so common in Asian culture that it is primarily one of the most toxic sources of anxieties. All these things have led to me realize how important it is to normalize the idea of meditation in my Taiwanese family and community, and I knew I needed to start with my mom.

I know that something as ‚Äúradical‚Äù as meditation isn‚Äôt one that you can just pitch, persuade or lecture to someone and they‚Äôll simply get it. The most you can do is shine, talk, and expose it to them through repetition that one day it‚Äôll influence them to try it themselves. I want to keep trying, and one day have my mom do the same thing for my dad and my older brother. I joked that I would love to get to a place where one day our family can begin our days with a joint meditation session.
