 One thing great about age and time is that it contains the greatest wisdom in teaching us to not be reactive to the little things. I always picture a wise old man sitting on the front of his porch, smiling and looking at people pass by day after day. He doesn't let the little things affect him and he knows the meaning of life because he's come face to face with mortality again and again, and his experience has taught him about what's important and what's not. He's able to be empathetic and understanding because he sees how easy it is for negative things like misunderstanding, hate, violence, anger, and even unhappiness to form not just in himself, but in the thousands of people he's interacted over his lifetime. But the truth is that time and age don't always give you that wisdom. It's not gained automatically just through the passing of time. 

Ever since I've done my inner work, I've noticed that there are some spiritual aspects in life that I am able to advise my mom on, and that always makes me feel proud and a little sad at the same time. I'm proud because I genuinely feel like I have wisdom that can improve her life after 60 by finding more peace, fulfillment, and happiness in it. I'm sad because I realize that the passing of time doesn't automatically equal the improvement in spiritual literacy. Just by offering some zooming-out frameworks, I found myself able to convince my mom to feel better about some actions that my dad does or even have a deeper empathy for how her younger brother (my uncle) misbehaves. 

I'm more convinced than ever that I want to continue to be a champion of not just improving my own but teaching others to improve their spiritual literacy. It's common in eastern culture to believe that this is gained just through daily repetition and time but I have definitely witnessed this not to be true. In fact, sometimes it can take a few generations before even a smidge of it is revealed. But I am starting to understand how everyone can gain this within his or her lifetime. 

This is definitely a mission worth waking up for.
