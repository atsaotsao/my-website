 When I was growing up, I occasionally heard adults talk about children and whether they were "good" at playing. This comment always baffled me. How could someone be "bad" at playing, especially as kids? I don't know if it's was because I was influenced by these comments, or whether was naturally creative in the way I think about play, I always prided myself in being an expert in the act of playing. Whenever I'm with friends, either we're at someones home, or out and about at a playground or in the wilderness, I always remember I would use my imagination to create the coolest and inclusive activities and games that send my friends begging for me.

As an adult, I've started to notice more how the gap in skills around playing start to widen. 
Time and time again, I feel that friends and colleagues around me have been so stuck in the loops of career and societal expectations that the act of playing always relates to traveling, eating, and alcohol consumption, and it makes me incredibly sad. But one thing that I'm extremely proud of is by simply setting example of someone who values playing and how it contributes to my overall roadmap of personal development, I've seen the influence it has. My girlfriend and close friend have both started picking color pencils to draw occasionally. Another close friend also came to an epiphany that "thinking" is his playing and he needs to do it more often (he said that connection was made when he heard me picking up my instruments). 

Who knew that playing could be my competitive advantage?
