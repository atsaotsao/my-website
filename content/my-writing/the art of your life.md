The Art of Your Life is about reminding individuals who are lost, down, angry, trapped, oppressed, that there's a complex beauty to this life. Their life. That even thought things can be hard, and even though the systems of power can often make us feel suffocated, there is so much power to taking a stop back and see the artwork of your life. To feel that you have the agency to play with the brushstroke That life has no bounds. That our beautiful painting, is ultimately about surrendering the source of all things, and allowing it to flow through us. We are conduits of it.
