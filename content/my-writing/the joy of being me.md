It's so joyful to be me.
To be able to stumble and get back up.
To smile even when hard things come tumbling down.
To greet the world with optimism, even when it's hard.

It's so joyful to be me.
To dance even when there is no music.
To paint even when there is no canvas.
To walk even when everyone is running.

It's so joyful to be me.
To hug two seconds longer just because
To tell someone you are proud of them just because
To hold space without expecting anything in return, just because.

I wasn't always joyful to be me,
but the moment I started
I felt like I learned the secret to the universe
And even after a long long day.

I'm always reminded how joyful it is to be me.
