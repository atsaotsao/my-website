 When's the last time you just go to be? In your most natural, calm, happiest, most authentic way? The more I have started to explore my own spirituality, the more I realize just how radical and difficult this concept is, and how it even relates to the internet's biggest promise. 

Simply being means being able to just do what you normally do without our society, people around us, and even the systems we live in getting in the way. To say that it's a luxury is an understatement, just as marginalized communities like the LGBT or racial minority groups are just finally creating enough noise where there are more open conversations around them. Just being, in a practical sense especially in a capitalistic world, also means where it's scalable and sustainable where you are also financially supported. The creator economy promises us that there will be increased access and therefore demand for things around writing (newsletter), drawing or creating art (NFT), and even just playing games (Twitch), and I would like to see how we continue to find ways where these platforms and channels are actually supporting people to find their authentic ways to pay their bills. What makes me sad is how the power of these platforms rather perverts what "being" means and influences people to behave in a way that they probably normally wouldn't (Influences on Instagram). 

One of my goals and philosophy behind my coaching is to find my own way to support my coaching mentee to find a way to learn to "be" through thinking and building out their ideas. It's something that takes a lot of practice and I want to see more people start being in tune with its power.
