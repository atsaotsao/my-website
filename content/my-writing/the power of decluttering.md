 I will never ever again underestimate the power of cleaning and decluttering. All my life I’ve been seeing it as an errand, admin work, and something that I will naturally deprioritize because it’s time-consuming and doesn’t directly contribute to my overall ambitions and goals in life. But over this past month, I’ve forced myself to reframe these activities and focus on understanding the importance and even enjoyment behind these monotonous tasks and have come out of the other side as a believer.

When I was going through my physical and even digital things and focusing on the process of discarding than organizing, I am also listening to my heart to decide what to keep. This constant act of listening to myself to determine which things are important to me and bring me joy, makes me feel that much more in tune with my inner self. I started to take out my Trumpet again and started practicing it again, even deciding to learn some jazz (I’ve only played classical music growing up). I’ve also noticed myself being more at peace with all the things going on around me, being less swayed by the waves of notifications, obligations, and stress points that daily life can give us.

The next challenge is to make all this sustainable for the long term. The important first step is realizing just how stressful clutter can be, so I’m always motivated to return things to where they belong instead of having the mindset of “dealing with it later.”
