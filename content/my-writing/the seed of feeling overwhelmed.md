These days I've been practicing a visualization exercise: whenever I feel the slightest feeling of overwhelmed, I try to pinpoint, acknowledge, and recognize that feeling as soon as possible. In this process I've noticed and am able to create a really interesting imagery: that my feeling of being overwhelmed will always start with a little seed. It could be a particular task, it could be a summation of a lot of tasks, but the more I think about it, the more I will notice me mentally pouring water on this seed and I could feel it very quickly sprout leaves, and vines, and sometimes the growth is beyond my control. The days where I let it completely overwhelm me is when my thoughts keep spiraling and it grows into a thick tree that blocks me from all my goals for that day. 

But with this trick, I'm learning to pause and stop watering this seed. Instead, I put it in my hands, thank it for what its trying to signal me, and simply throw it into the wind and let the universe carry it away. It's not always easy, but its a start.
