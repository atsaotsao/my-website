The space I hold for other  
Itâ€™s just what I do, no bother  
If you are thankful just pass to another

When all we do is give and share  
Then we no longer are concern in what is fair  
We become like family. Same hands, feet, even our hair.

I dream about such day where we can just be  
To trust each other. He, she and we.  
And simply be fine when one gets more? Oh em gee.
