I read an¬†[article in Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/zuckerberg-finds-its-not-easy-to-tame-facebooks-growth-obsession/)¬†two years ago about what the culture of Facebook is/was like and was mortified to find that out that it was the kind where CEO Mark Zuckerberg would end his all-hands meeting with a cheery quote, ‚ÄúDomination." It may have been an attempt of a joke to portray himself as a cartoon villain a decade ago, but that persona is not far from the truth today based on Facebook‚Äôs role in spreading misinformation, fueling chaos and confusion in places like Myanmar, and repeatedly violated privacy concerns about user over personal data in just the past few years.

Look I know, it‚Äôs so easy to throw more ripe tomatoes at Facebook at the start of 2020 who‚Äôs already been under the pillory of intense criticism and scrutiny, but the truth is, the share of Americans who believe that technology companies have a positive impact on society has dropped from 71 percent in 2015 to 50 percent in 2019, according to a¬†[2019 Pew Research Center survey](https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/07/29/americans-have-become-much-less-positive-about-tech-companies-impact-on-the-u-s/). As a technologist, seeing those number hurts me, but even more so ignites a fire one me to want to become a part of a new generation of thinkers, makers, and doers who can usher in the new age of more ethnical, non-engagement driven, and decentralized technologies that can tackle the right problems. I no longer believe that everything can be solved with a ‚Äúlight‚Äù solution, where building an app or digital platform with a beautiful interface and delightful user experience is not only unnecessary but also way too idealized way of approaching problem-solving.

I don't think anyone should haphazardly pick up an ax and start chopping away at the beanstalk, or any channels we have in our lives where the tech giants can climb down from their castles floating on clouds to creep into our lives, but it's important to recognize that they are only as powerful as we let them be.
