Sometimes it's hard to feel like increasing awareness is a good thing, at least in the short term.
The more that you are aware of, the more you see, the more you cannot unsee, and the more you now bear the burden of the full weight of that reality. A classic example for me is the movie Matrix. I always think back to that scene where the character Cyper is [eating a steak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvdAznoFqY). In this reality, he knows that the steak is not real but he no longer cares.

In my own personal journey, I feel like every single day I am increasing my awareness of my internal world, my relationship with my partner, and the external world that I need to live in, and even though increasing awareness means being able to enjoy it more (I noticed the richness of colors like the green in leaves even more than before) but it also means there are parts of reality that feel more difficult. Is ignorance really bliss?

Some days, it really does feel like it. Some days I am jealous of the people who can navigate through life without worrying too much or without spending that much time introspecting. But I also have confidence that in the long-term it pays offâ€”it pays off the really see the world and myself as it is and continue to learn to accept it completely as is, all parts of it.
