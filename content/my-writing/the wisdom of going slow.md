 I never realized the wisdom of going slow until I was washing dishes one day. I've mentioned on here before that one of the things I've tried to work on is becoming better at cleaning. Since my girlfriend is an expert, and by an expert, I mean someone who literally had dreamt about running a cleaning empire, so I always knew I had a lot of catching up to do. In order for me to try to utilize a framework of consistency to hopefully pick up a better habit of cleaning, I started with setting a 20-minute timer each day solely for cleaning and tidying. 
I also learned quickly that 20 minutes always feels longer than I imagined, so in order to fill the time, I would have to wash the dishes or clean the table more slowly. The more slowly I did, I naturally because more thorough, and weirdly I found zen in the process. 

I remember running my hands softly across the non-stick pan after cleaning it with a sponge a few times to try to feel the groove and grease that may still be left on. At that moment, I felt like I truly understand what Marie Kondo also talks about when you're being "polite" to your possession and being more caring in how you treat them, and how they will reward you by lasting longer. At that moment, I truly get it. I also understood how going fast has taken me to places of success I have never imagined, but if I can learn to combine it with also the intention of going slow, I will be able to harness both powers and no one will be able to catch me.
