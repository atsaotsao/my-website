 One advice I usually give anyone who's trying to develop new daily habits is that there will always come to a moment where you look at the amount of repetitions you've already put in, and think to yourself, "what was the point of all this?" You may have saw some compounding benefits already, you may have not, but it's extremely easy to fall down into a spiral and think to yourself that it all didn't matter. In these key moments, It's important to have witnesses, partners, or collaborators who have seen your journey and can attest to how they have helped you changed for the better. 

The road of personal development is often lonely, and when the waters get more turbulent, it's important to find as much as help and support you can get so you don't stop rowing.
