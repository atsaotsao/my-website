It's hard to write when theres' this tight ball in the middle of the chest
the same tightness that makes you wonder if you will feel better the next day
the same tightness that paralyzes you, shooting signals of flight and fear up and down you
And you wonder, when will this ever end.

It feels a game without a clock, and in this game the ball runs the show
I can try my best to pass it, dribble it, spike it, tap it, kick it but it will still be there
It's there the way a statue is there in that memorial you last visited
It feels solid, built to last, and I often wonder if I'll have to carry it forever.

Even breathing can only get you so far. Like ocean waves eroding the beach but it still lasts.
Some days I wonder, is this something I'll have to deal with for the rest of my life?
