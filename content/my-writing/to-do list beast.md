A to-do list is a beast sometime  
One that stares at you, with it glaring eyes  
Taunting you to face it with courage  
Challenging you to poke at its eyes  
To check the box or cross it out  
But there are days where I grow weak in the knees  
And one slash, two slash, three  
Doesnâ€™t seem to make a dent  
And he growls and growls, swallowing me up as a whole  
Iâ€™m left with my corpse, struggling to even ask for help.  
These days are the hardest  
But even in these days there are hope  
I learned that all it takes is bit a momentum  
And to pick yourself up, dust off your shield  
Instead of taming it, learn to embrace it  
The beast no longer seem monstrous  
But rather a reflection of who you are  
And whoever you are, wherever you are at  
Thatâ€™s all there is.  
And there is not thing to be afraid of.
