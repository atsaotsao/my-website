Try going through a day with full gratitude.

Every single step you take down your usual block.  
Every leaf poking through the edges of the sidewalk.  
Everything that is said by strangers front back and beside you.  
Every sip of your favorite brew at the familiar coffee shop.  
Every note of music dripping out of the nearby park.
Every single hint of color on that poster you just walked by.  
Everything your partner said or didnâ€™t say to you.  
Every thought of everything your parents have done for you.  
Every time you make mistakes and no one is there to berate you, but instead, give you space to learn.  
Every breath of fresh air.  
Every delicate moment of silence.

Try going through a full day, and then tell me you didnâ€™t have a good day.
