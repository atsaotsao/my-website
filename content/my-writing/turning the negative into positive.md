One of the skills I'm still learning is how to better at is reframing how I look at a scenario, especially a negative one, into something that's positive. For example, recently I've felt a lot of frustrations around my boss' leadership skills, and how he fails to more conscious about the things going on that are making our team less happy and productive. Even after confronting him about his blind spots, his responses were lackluster and apathetic. While I fumed about the incompetence of a leader, I started to think about a library of experience that I've collected about traits about good vs managers, and I realized that the best things that had happened to me about working with bad managers are that I've not only able to appreciate when the good manager comes along, I also learned things that I would do vs not do when I become a leader myself.

The hardest part of this skill is finding the balance between learning the difference between "optimism" and "internal self-justification." By reframing the scenario, it makes it easy to get along my day and learn to cope with his poor management skills but it also creates an effect where I am justifying to myself the reasons to be more content and persevere through obstacles. And the truth is, sometimes these are signs that perhaps it's time to move on to something better.
