 If there's one thing I learned from host six guided psychedelic trips for my friends last year is that unbundling the layers that separate us from our authentic true selves takes a lot of time, and it varies a lot. The most fascinating aspect is the variance of it is, despite most of us coming from generally similar family and cultural background. One interesting correlation I noticed is that the more successful, in terms of being in a high-paying and steady job, the more  barrier that are present that are holding themselves back. Perhaps it speaks to the the amount of societal, cultural, and familial expectations and pressure that even though have propelled an individual to place where they have a lot of disposable income, it also feels like they have a lot of part of themselves eroded away or even hidden beneath layers and years of muck and guck. 

Ever since I've done those sessions of guided healing, I have also casually perform a slight longitudinal study to observe whether there are long term positive effects in terms of personal and spiritual growth, and I always smile when I think of them: 
- One individual recently put up her art/photo for her very first gallery show ever and have already seen people responding positively to it
- One individual decided to forgo a steady route of promotion (apparently even being the youngest person to be promoted to a VP level position at the firm) and switch to a new job that despite having less pay, have better culture and most importantly work life balance.
- One individual finally took his Mental Health seriously and gotten a therapist and even trying other forms of healing include a professional ketamine-assisted therapy.

I have personally witnessed too many positive effects of how an intentional and ceremonial use of psychedelics can complement one's personal and spiritual growth, and this year I am not only committed to making the personal project around it happen, but also vow to talk about it more so more people can learn to do so safely and for better and higher purpose.

If you ever want to learn more about it, please don't ever hesitate to reach out.
