 Understanding your own distractions is an underrated skill-set. When it comes to productivity, it doesn't just simply mean eliminating distraction so that we can be as focused at the task at hand as possible, but rather a holistic understanding of our distractions, why we're distracted by it, and when are opportunities we should reduce it while other times we can take advantage of it. This has been a skill that I've been trying to hone in for a long time and I still find a lot of joy experimenting with it. 

Take the idea of a "background entertainment" â€” the idea is that while you're working, you're putting on a move or tv show that you can simply play in background without paying a lot of attention. The idea is to trick yourself that you're on a relaxing Saturday afternoon where you have all the time in the world to relax and watch TV on a couch where in reality you're working on a side-project. Now I won't get too much into the art of picking the right type of entertainment for this work mode, but I was pleased to see how when my partner adopted this in our work, she was able to be more relaxed and more productive in some scenarios. 

Our distractions are more than just distractions, they're clues to why we are who we are, and what kind of things have a greater gravity pull of our attention is something we should not only be aware, understand, but sometimes take advantage of in order for the ever pursuit of becoming better versions of ourselves. 

So, what is distracting you these days?
