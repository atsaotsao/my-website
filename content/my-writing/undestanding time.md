 A dragonfly dies in 5 years.
An avocado tree takes 10-15 years to bear fruit.
Two facts related to time that I learned in the past month that made me think more about the nature of time; how precious it is and why it's so easy to freak out at the loss of it. The more conversations I have with individuals, the more I realize time-anxiety is at the root of the most anxieties we feel on a daily basis, and not just on Sundays. 

Time is something that I am still finding a way to understand more, and therefore still finding ways for it to bring me joy than anxiety. One thing I discovered is that time is just like sand, the stronger you try to grasp it and hold on to it tightly, the more likely it falls right out of your hand. Those early minutes where I spend my days meditating started out feeling like, "I don't have time for this!" But time-management to me means being strict and making time for the all the things that really matters. That includes slowing down, looking at the sky, and sometimes just breathing. 

These days when a friend, a colleague, or even stranger reaches out to me to ask me, "Do you have time?" I often tell them I do. I may not have a full-time job, but I also have time to help others. Time giving value to others is never time wasted.
