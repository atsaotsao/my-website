When a city transitions from summer to fall, a lot of things happen.  
Jackets come out. Colors become more dulled. You hear of people taking more rain checks.

Two days ago it was rainy and everyone was moody. I could still hear the bus conductor yelling at the oncoming cars, trying to get ahead of each other. Itâ€™s as if everyone is in a rush to time; where itâ€™s warm and welcoming.

The cold isnâ€™t unbearable, but it had an effect on the collective conscious. You see less smiles. You hear more grunts. This is especially true for single people, they often tell me they feel more lonely and find an urge to find someone to cuddle through the last few months.

I was never like that, you see.  
When I was living in California, I hated that everyday was sunny and perfect. It made my darkness seem so invalidated. I had nowhere to hide. The weather was warm, yet I was always scared.

When Iâ€™m here, even if it gets colder, Iâ€™m reminded of the wonder that sits at every street corner. I remember walking down avenues with my headphones and a big smile on my face, even if itâ€™s pouring rain or blasting snow.

The cold means change, and it means transformation. It means once again I get to use the opportunity to embrace a new city and a new me.
