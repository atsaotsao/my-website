I've been thinking a lot about the word *artistry* and here's why you should too, esp in the age of AI.

And no it doesn't apply to just artists and creatives.


I speak to a lot of people who are in a crossroad or transition, and one of the biggest fears they have is around what happens when they switch jobs, titles, industries, or even career paths in general. 

They ask questions like:
• "What happens when I'm no longer in tech?"
• "What if I am no longer want to climb the corporate ladder?"
• "What if I wanted to build something of my own?"
• "What if I wanted to become an author?"

Behind these questions I always sense a lot of self-doubt and fear

Because it IS scary to think about one's profession morphing into a different shape. 

If your profession is a jacket you've been wearing for a long time (and I bet at one point you looked mighty fine wearing it) it must be so scary to take it off. 

Maybe you had to take it off by force and without warning, and that left you feeling betrayed and even naked.

But here's a critical point:

What you DO (your professional work) is not the same as why you're HERE (your artistry)

Many of us mistakenly believe our professional work defines us. 

This creates so much complex confusion and chaos within us when we change directions or paths because temporarily, it's scary to feel lost.

And it's important to remember this:

Your professional work is simply how you make money, which can change and evolve. 

But Your artistry is the unchanging truth of (1) how you’re designed, and (2) what you're here to contribute to the world. 

And here's the most beautiful thing. When you operate within your artistry, you exist in a category of one. Tehre is no one "ahead of" you or "behind" you. 

There is no AI that is going to replace you because it can't be copied, templated, or reverse-eneirred— making "competition" irrelevant. 

This is why finding your artistry is more important than ever.

P.S. If you feel called to discover that artistry within you but don't know where to start, let's chat

## AI Generated Script for Reel

### 🎬 **REEL SCRIPT: "The Jacket"**

**🎯 Hook (2 sentences, open loop style):**

> I used to believe my job title defined me.  
> Until it got ripped away—and I was left staring at the mirror, not recognizing who I was anymore.

---

**📍 Context (Set up the 'before' state, old belief):**

> For years, I wore my profession like a perfectly tailored jacket.  
> It made me feel accomplished, safe—even admired.  
> But what happens when that jacket no longer fits?  
> Or worse, when someone else takes it from you?

---

**🕰 5-Second Moment (The shift, a visual + emotional trigger):**

> I remember standing in my bedroom, holding that business card with my old title—  
> and realizing it didn’t mean anything anymore.  
> The weight of it was gone.  
> And so was my sense of identity.

---

**💡 Internal Realization (Emotional shift, new belief):**

> That was the moment I understood:  
> what I _do_ is not the same as _why I’m here._  
> My job can change. My title can vanish.  
> But my artistry? That’s forever.

---

**📣 Call to Action (1-2 lines, inspire or challenge):**

> So if you're feeling lost in the in-between, ask yourself:  
> Who are you without the jacket?  
> Because when you find your artistry, you become untouchable. AI can’t copy that. No one else can.

### 🎥 B-ROLL SUGGESTIONS:

**Opening shot (Cinematic hook):**

- You, centered in frame, slowly removing a blazer or jacket.
    
- Close-up of your hands folding or dropping it onto a bed or chair.
    
- Soft lighting, slightly somber music.
    

**Context shots (Before/Old Identity):**

- Slow pan of a desk setup, glowing laptop screen late at night.
    
- You walking in business attire, blurred background of an office or street.
    
- A hand holding a business card, adjusting a collar, looking in the mirror.
    

**5-Second Moment shots:**

- Standing still in front of a mirror, slightly disoriented expression.
    
- Letting a business card fall to the floor in slow motion.
    
- Close-up on your eyes as something clicks emotionally.
    
- Pull focus shot from the business card to your face.
    

**Internal realization shots:**

- You sitting cross-legged on the floor, journaling or sketching.
    
- Soft smile as you look out a window, light pouring in.
    
- Abstract B-roll of nature (water, wind in trees, sunrise) to represent transformation.
    

**Call to action closing shots:**

- Walking forward confidently, dressed casually, jacket slung over your shoulder.
    
- Typing on a laptop again, but this time in a cozy space (coffee shop, home) with plants, artwork, or creative tools nearby.
    
- Optional text overlay of: _"Your artistry can’t be replaced."_


## AI Revised

I’ve been thinking a lot about the word artistry—and here’s why you should too. Especially in the age of AI.

And no, it’s not just for artists or creatives.

I talk to a lot of people at a crossroads—folks in transition, wondering what’s next. And one of the biggest fears I hear is this:

What happens when the title changes?  
When I leave tech?  
When I stop climbing the corporate ladder?  
When I want to write a book, build something of my own, or start over completely?

Behind these questions, I always sense a quiet fear.

Because it is scary—to let your profession morph into a new shape.

If your career has been a jacket you’ve worn for years (and at some point, you probably looked damn good in it), of course it’s scary to take it off.

Maybe you had to take it off by force.  
Without warning.  
And it left you feeling raw, betrayed… even exposed.

But here’s the shift that changes everything:

👉 What you do is not the same as why you’re here. 
👉 Your profession is not your artistry.

Most of us confuse the two.  
We believe our work defines us.  
So when we change direction, we feel lost. Unmoored. Like we’re starting from scratch.

But your job? It’s just one of many vehicles.  
It’s how you earn money. It will evolve.

Your artistry is different.

It’s the deeper current. The through-line.  
It’s the part of you that’s always been there—  
how you’re designed.  
What you’re here to contribute.

And when you live and work from that place?  
You exist in a category of one.

There is no AI that is going to replace you because it can't be copied, templated, or reverse-engineered.

Artistry makes competition irrelevant.
And it makes you unforgettable.

This is why finding your artistry—especially now—isn’t optional. It’s essential.

And I can't wait to be here to witness it✨

### jumping off point

Artistry is not something you can simplify, label, and put in a box. It's something you can feel and I know you've felt it. It's not just about what happens when get moved by art, It's also about when you come across something or someone that you can feel that it's built, created, or deleivered with intentioan, integrity, and heart. It may be a mom & pop shop in your neighborhood. It could be a specialized consultant that believes deeply in their work. It can someone you come across here on LI who writes beautifully. Here's why the artistry is important: - It sets you apart during a time dominated by AI - It allows you to identify yoru competitive advantage and "zone of genius" that allows you to do things that best suited to your strengths - It's what helps you connect most deeply to the inner parts of yourself that believes in yourself - It has the power to not just make the kind of money you want, but inspire and move others in the process
