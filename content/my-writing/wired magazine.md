 One of my favorite things to read is [Wired](https://www.wired.com/). Growing up in Taiwan, I‚Äôve always been looking for ways to read more English content because it wasn‚Äôt always readily available at my fingertips. It was also during a time where it wasn‚Äôt that easy to find what I was looking for on the internet. On rare occasions, I would be able to go to an English bookshop that contained all the western magazines and books that I can dream of. I would never forget looking at the typical display shelves of all these vibrant and intriguing magazines, all ranging in genres and types. Since these magazines were pretty expensive, especially when compared to the books I want to buy, I always saw them as luxuries that I can flip through while I was there.

When I finally came to the U.S for college, the first time I had my paycheck working as an IT assistant at the Law Library, I bought my first magazine subscription. I think it was Men‚Äôs Health, as I knew that I wanted to become ‚Äúhealthier‚Äù but had no idea how. I still remember the rush of getting a physical magazine sent to my doorstep every day. So many colors, visuals, for such a measly price. Flipping through these physical magazines has become a true joy bringer for me.

Ever since I moved to New York, something about Wired magazine drew me in. Perhaps it‚Äôs my thirst for wanting to understand technology as I struggled with it most of my early life. Perhaps it‚Äôs the way it‚Äôs designed, where the spine always contained the color gradient of what‚Äôs being used in the cover. Nevertheless, I‚Äôve read and collected basically all Wired magazine issues since at least 5 years ago (including this month‚Äôs issue, I read and kept 66 issues).

There were many points in time I had to consider simply resorting to reading the digital versions. I also am subscribed to [The New Yorker](https://www.newyorker.com/) and [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/) and have relied on the pick and choose a method to curate the best reads relevant to me. But for Wired, maybe because of my romantic stubbornness, has become the only medium that I consume from front to back, regardless of what they‚Äôre talking about. It often makes me think about the trouble with algorithm-driven recommendations and personalization. For one, the algorithms would never have pushed me to read a long-form [article](https://www.wired.com/story/one-mans-amazing-journey-to-the-center-of-the-bowling-ball/) about bowling ball design but I did and thoroughly enjoyed peeking into a world I would have never known.

Every time I look up at my bookshelf to see the wired magazine stacked together. I‚Äôm so thankful. Thankful to have discovered this love for technology, because it has largely contributed to my understanding and philosophy toward seeing the evils and goodness that technology can bring to this world. I can‚Äôt wait to be part of the good parts.
