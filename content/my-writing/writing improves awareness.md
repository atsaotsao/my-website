 I knew when I started writing that one of the biggest benefit of writing is that it improves clarity in thinking and self-expression. On paper, it makes sense. You are taking what's in your head and putting down in the format of language in front of you. It forces you to construct your thought, to engage it, to challenge it, and to think more deeply about it. It's humbling because it sometimes tells me things I knew but never had the courage to admit. For example, in my morning pages, I like to write about the things that went wrong the day before. When I'm writing it out loud, especially in a kind manner that is in the tone of a old but tough friend who cares, it always make me feel seen and heard. It reminds me of my flaws and strengths, but especially in ways that is constructive and productive.

Sometimes I still forget that people don't write everyday. Even if it for fun, like trying to see what it's like to have your stream of consciousness flow out for the sake of flowing out. Everything I have learned last year about improving my spiritual literacy is based on the foundation of having a strong sense of awareness around my inner and external realities and I have writing to thank for it.
