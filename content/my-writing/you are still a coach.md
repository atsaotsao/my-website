You are still a coach.

Weeks gone by and no matter what you do, you still haven't found a new client
You are still a coach.

You look at your bank account wondering when the next payment will come in
You are still a coach.

Your client suddenly told you that he no longer wants to work with you.
It leaves you feeling rejected, and you start to doubt your own abilities to do the work.
You are still a coach.

The fear around money still sometimes grabs hold of you like a Boa constrictor.
Squeezing the air out of your lungs and you can't breath.
You are still a coach.

You're at a party and someone asks you
"So what do you do?"
You answer: "I'm a coach now"
And you see them politely nod 
but you have a feely they didn't really "get it."
You are still a coach.

You are taking time off first time all year to attend a wedding
And you find yourself in the middle of the lush forest somewhere in Canada
Drinking every drop of the serenity.
Reminding yourself the life you are trying to build.
The people you want to help.

You are still a coach
