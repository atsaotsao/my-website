"If I leave my traditional path, I’m throwing away everything I’ve worked for."

YOU DON'T HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT ANYMORE

One of the scariest things about switching industries, jobs, or even career paths is the feeling that you've wasted something. 

You've wasted time maybe gaining all that domain expertise about that ubsiness, market or industry.

Or wasted time fostering relationships, or skillsets 

I know that feeling because I felt that when I made a conscious choice to step away from working in tech. 

It was scary because not only did I had to work with the fear of starting a coaching business, but I also had so much PM, no-code, tech tools skills that range from data visualization, api, UX design, or even scrum planning that I felt like I have wasted. 

But the most powerful thing is realizing that every single thing I've done, every converstaion, every line of code, ever Jira ticket I've written led me to this point

And every part of my experience creates the foundation for what's next.

I thought leaving tech meant throwing away everything I’d worked for.

But then I was cleaning out my Google Drive—hundreds of docs, roadmaps, no-code builds—  
and it hit me:

None of it was wasted.  
It’s not erased.  
It’s woven into what I do now.

If you’re afraid to pivot because you think you’re starting from scratch…  
you’re not.  
You’re starting from here.

👉 If you’re in a season of transition and want to talk it through, I’d love to connect.
