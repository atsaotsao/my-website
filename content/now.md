- Running a group coaching container that combines lessons around ancestry, artistry, and earth-based practices to help anyone navigate crisis and build resilience  (*IN PROGRESS* [email me](mailto:andrew@codelesscoach.com) if you want a sneak peek.)
- Doing 1-on-1 [coaching](coaching.md) for fellow soul-led professionals deep feelers, artists, and creative entrepreneurs
- Hosting [The Art of Your Life](https://theartofyourlife.transistor.fm/) podcast show (planning on getting this up and running again soon, so stay tuned!)
- Working part-time as a mentor and internship accessors for the [NUS Overseas program](https://enterprise.nus.edu.sg/education-programmes/nus-overseas-colleges/) in NYC
- Facilitating slow, patient, and inclusive website building for aligned collaborators (here's [an example](https://www.mainlanderstl.com/) I'm building for a chef in St. Louis)
- Volunteering at neighborhood garden 
- Exploring painting abstract art as a liberatory practice
- Reconnecting with my lineage & ancestry is through combing through, archiving, and synthesizing artifacts from my deceased grandpa & grandma
  
I am interested in creating and being part of spaces, projects, and movements that provides the spaciousness to explore these questions:
- **What does it mean to be in alignment of our truest selves?**
- **What is freedom, and how is our individual freedom connected to collective liberation?**
- **What is lost in our ancestry and lineage and how can we reconnect to it? How can we reclaim it and what wisdom and support can we receive to navigate where we are?**
- **How do we embody more love and light?**
- **How do we incorporate land care as part of personal care?**
- **How do we stay resilient, abundant, and loving during times of crisis and large uncertainties?**
- **How do we create relationships, communities, and entire ecosystems that thrives on reciprocity?**
- **How can we finally see our multitudes, our woven quality of artistry, and harness it to help create a new reimagined world?**
