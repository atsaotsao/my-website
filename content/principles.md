### love is the central work.

If there's one thing I've learned in this lifetime of studying, practicing, falling, failing, crying, hurting, persevering, and integrating it's the work of love. It's finally finding the full-colored, abundant, expansive, and unconditional love within myself and realize how much I deserve it; how much we all deserve it regardless of what we've done, where we've come from. It's learning why Bell Hooks famously writes:
> We do not have to love. We choose to love 

And it's the kind of work that requires us to stop avoiding, bypassing, and distracting so that we can finally face ourselves and the people around us with the courage to be honest and accoutable.
I fundamentally believe that all the biggest problems in the world is caused by the cycles of loveliness on a personal and collective level. And in all variations of my work, I will always center the work of helping myself and others along the way come home to it.



### practice relational wholeness

A pivotal part of my journey is accepting the world as is rather what should be, and one thing is realizing how the majority of spaces and relationships we're in does not encourage us to show up with our whole selves; especially including the parts of us that we have shamed, neglected, or even exiled in order to survive within the family systems, relationship dynamics, and power structures we found ourselves in. Huge part of self work is learning to discern who, where, and what still perpetuates those narratives, and unlearning and learning to build inner love and trust to reclaim and embody these new multitudes; and hardness the power the comes with it. Finally and most importantly, the bulk of the work lies in remaining whole while being in relation to others and believing in reimaigned world and spaces that we can coexist and collaborate as our whole selves.


### prioritize creativity
When 

Prioritizing creativity is a privilege, but it's a privilege a lot of us have we just ignored it. And that's not entirely our fault because that's the message a lot of us received our entire lives even all the way into adulthood. It's the same messaging that places yours and my creativity as "nice-to-haves." If you're lucky you found a way to channel it into hobbies that brings you joy, but it often may feel disconnected from the work that can help you make money or build the life you want. If you are also lucky enough to make a living with your art, you might find it challenging to reconnect to that creativity in a consistent manner.  

We live in a world that benefits from the outcomes of creativity without rewarding them. Creativity is the bloodline that keeps the aliveness
